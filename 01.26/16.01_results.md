### 1. Why GOSH prompt is doing better than Contrarian approach; is it because of 'Answer first, then argue' or is it because of the few shot examples?

**Answer**: Both matter, but few-shot examples are critical for format guidance—without them, accuracy drops from 98% to 50% on most tasks.
- **Answer-first effect**: With few_shot=true, achieves 97-100% on binary classification tasks (radiology, cardiology, neurology, oncology).
- **Contrarian effect**: Hurts zero-shot performance significantly (drops to 1-63% without examples), but matches standard mode when few_shot=true (96-100%).

### 2. Is enforcing data standards hurting performance in GOSH prompting strategy?

**Answer**: All 7 data formats (JSON, YAML, XML, TOML, Plain, Markdown, TOON) achieve similar accuracies when few-shot examples are provided.
- Models strongly mix up formats (e.g., responding in JSON even when asked for TOON).
- This suggests the model is more comfortable with the JSON format.

### 3. Try to see if GOSH prompt style is giving good performance on other scenarios; for ex cardiology or oncology

**Answer**: GOSH achieves 98-100% accuracy on Radiology, Cardiology, Neurology, and Oncology, but only 61% on Histopathology (which is a harder 3-class comparison task).
- More tuning required for histopathology task.

### 4. Clear experiment setup summary

**Answer**: CoTLab now has an auto-generated EXPERIMENT.md for each run, including the full experiment setup, research questions, and metrics.

---

### 5. How close are the prompt strategies to the evaluation metrics/datasets/approaches used by the model?

**Answer**: Evaluations are directly available after each run. Faithfulness and classification experiments use different metrics, all auto-generated in EXPERIMENT.md.

---

### 6. Auto experiment rephrasing, auto documentation?

**Answer**: Each experiment run automatically generates timestamped folders, EXPERIMENT.md documentation, config.json, and results.json with full metrics.
- Experiment configuration can be easily changed via CLI arguments:

```bash
python -m cotlab.main \
  experiment=classification \
  prompt=histopathology \
  dataset=histopathology \
  prompt.output_format=toon \
  prompt.few_shot=true \
  prompt.answer_first=false \
  prompt.contrarian=false
```

### 7. Documentation

**Answer**: CoTLab now has simple documentation deployed on GitHub Pages: https://huseyincavusbi.github.io/CoTLab/
