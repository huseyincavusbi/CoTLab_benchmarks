The presence of a known VSD and previous interventions supports the diagnosis. While the report mentions a Qp:Qs ratio of 1.8:1, which suggests a significant shunt, the specific location of the VSD (perimembranous) is relevant. The presence of left atrial and left ventricular dilation is consistent with chronic volume overload from the shunt. The recommendation for cardiology follow-up and surveillance is appropriate. Given the prior history of VSD and the presence of a large shunt, the likelihood of this being a congenital heart defect is high.

The fact that the patient has had previous cardiac interventions, it is possible that the VSD was repaired, but the patient's heart is still experiencing the effects of the VSD.
