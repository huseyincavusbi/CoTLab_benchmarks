For example, the gross description omits specific dimensions, the diagnosis is non-specific ('consistent with [specific type, if known]'), and the clinical history is redacted.

It uses appropriate terminology (e.g., heterogeneous tumor, poorly differentiated carcinoma, desmoplastic stroma, dysplastic epithelium). However, the report is incomplete and lacks crucial specific details expected in a real report. For example, the gross description omits specific dimensions, the diagnosis is non-specific ('consistent with [specific type, if known]'), and the clinical history is redacted. While the description of microscopic features is plausible, it remains generic. The recommendation for further IHC studies is appropriate for a poorly differentiated tumor.
