Patient is on ibrutinib therapy. Patient presents with increasing shortness of breath and chest pain.\n\n**GROSS DESCRIPTION:**\nSpecimen consists of a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm portion of lung tissue, weighing 18 grams. The specimen is received in formalin. The external surface is unremarkable. On sectioning, the lung parenchyma is extensively replaced by a solid, white-tan, firm infiltrate. The infiltrate is centered around the hilum and extends peripherally. The pleura is unremarkable.\n\n**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**\nSections show lung parenchyma extensively infiltrated by a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical lymphoid cells. The cells are large, with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are frequent. The background contains scattered small lymphocytes, consistent with the patient's history of CLL/SLL. Scattered reactive macrophages are also present. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. The large atypical lymphoid cells are positive for CD20, BCL6, and MUM1. The large atypical lymphoid cells are negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, and BCL2. The small lymphocytes are positive for CD20 and CD5. The macrophages are positive for CD68.\n\n**DIAGNOSIS:**\nMetastatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), consistent with Richter transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).\n\n**COMMENT:**\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical findings are consistent with metastatic DLBCL. The presence of scattered small lymphocytes positive for CD5 is consistent with the underlying CLL/SLL. The IHC profile (CD20+, BCL6+, MUM1+, CD10-, BCL2-) is characteristic of a germinal center B-cell like (GCB) DLBCL, but the MUM1 positivity suggests a non-GCB subtype. The negative BCL2 staining is notable given the patient's history of CLL/SLL, which is typically BCL2 positive.\n\n**Generated Report:**\n\n**CLINICAL HISTORY:** 59-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic",

The specimen consists of skin, subcutaneous fat, pectoralis major muscle, and breast tissue. The skin overlying the tumor is ulcerated and thickened. The tumor is a firm, irregular mass measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm, located centrally within the breast tissue. The tumor is tan-white to gray-brown, with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor abuts the pectoralis major muscle but does not grossly invade it. The nipple-areola complex is involved. Nipple-areola complex is 1.5 cm from the closest surgical margin. The deep surgical margin is 1.0 cm from the tumor. The lateral surgical margin is 0.5 cm from the tumor. The superior surgical margin is 1.5 cm from the tumor. The anterior surgical margin is 1.5 cm from the tumor. Lymphovascular invasion is identified grossly. Grossly identified sentinel lymph nodes are negative for tumor.\n**Microscopic Description:** Sections show invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS). The tumor demonstrates marked pleomorphism, high mitotic activity, and prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells are arranged in cords and nests. The tumor invades lymphovascular channels. Lymphovascular invasion is confirmed microscopically. Sentinel lymph nodes (3 nodes) are negative for metastatic carcinoma. The tumor is positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for HER2.\n**Diagnosis:** Invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (IDC-NOS), left breast. Tumor size: 6.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm. Margins: Anterior 1.5 cm, Superior 1.5 cm, Lateral 0.5 cm, Deep 1.0 cm. Nipple-areola complex involved. Lymphovascular invasion present.

The femoral component shows extensive fibrinous material adherent to its surface, particularly over the patellar articulating surface. The tibial component shows some fibrinous material, but less extensive than the femoral component. The polyethylene insert shows significant wear, with visible scratches and gouges.

The femoral component interface demonstrates a significant inflammatory reaction, characterized by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, along with multinucleated giant cells, consistent with a foreign body reaction. There is evidence of loosening, indicated by the presence of granulation tissue and fibrous tissue separating the component from the bone.
