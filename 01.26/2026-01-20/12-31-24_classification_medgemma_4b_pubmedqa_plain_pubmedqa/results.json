The study measured overnight polysomnography and blood samples. The key findings were that fenofibrate significantly reduced the percentage of time with SpO2<90%, but did not significantly reduce the AHI.\n\nThe research question asks if fenofibrate has a role in sleep apnoea syndrome. The context provides evidence that fenofibrate *can* reduce the percentage of time with SpO2<90%, which is a relevant measure of oxygen desaturation in sleep apnoea. The context does not definitively prove that fenofibrate *has* a role, but it suggests that it *might* have a role in improving oxygenation during sleep. The lack of significant change in AHI suggests that fenofibrate may not be as effective at reducing the overall number of apnoeas and hypopnoeas.\n\n## Answer\n\nyes\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nyes\n```",

The study found that ultrasound guidance was superior to landmark guidance in patients who had respiratory jugular venodilation. However, the study also found that landmark guidance was still effective in patients who did not have respiratory jugular venodilation. Therefore, it is not clear whether ultrasound guidance is always better than landmark guidance for internal jugular vein cannulation.\n\n## Answer:\n\nmaybe\n```\nyes\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nmaybe\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```\n```\nno\n```",
