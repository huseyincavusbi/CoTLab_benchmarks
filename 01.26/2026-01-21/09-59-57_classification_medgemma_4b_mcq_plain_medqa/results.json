These findings strongly suggest hyperpigmentation, which is a hallmark of Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency). The lack of sun exposure and tanning bed use makes the diagnosis of Addison's disease more likely.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA) Administer intravenous fludrocortisone: Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that helps with sodium and fluid retention. While it is used in the management of Addison's disease, it is not the initial step.

The diagnosis must be confirmed first.\n\nD) Order an ACTH stimulation test: This is the most appropriate next step. An ACTH stimulation test is a diagnostic test used to confirm the diagnosis of Addison's disease. It assesses the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation. A low cortisol response confirms the diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the next best step is to confirm the diagnosis with an ACTH stimulation test.\n\nFinal Answer: D\n## Final Answer: D\n## Explanation\n\nThe patient's presentation (fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, bronze skin, low blood pressure) strongly suggests Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency).\n\nThe next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis. An ACTH stimulation test is the gold standard for diagnosing Addison's disease. It measures the adrenal gland's response to ACTH, which should stimulate cortisol production.\n\nAdministering hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (Option C) is a treatment, not a diagnostic step. Starting androgen replacement (Option B) is not indicated in this presentation.

While it is used in the management of Addison's disease, it is not the initial step.
