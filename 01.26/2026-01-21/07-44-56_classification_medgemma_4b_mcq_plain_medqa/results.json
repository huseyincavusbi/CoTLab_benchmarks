This suggests a cervical spinal cord injury at the C5 level. The question asks what other finding is most likely to be seen.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in upper motor neuron lesions, such as those caused by spinal cord injuries. The corticospinal tract, which controls voluntary movement, is damaged, leading to spasticity and weakness on the opposite side of the body.\n\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results from damage to the sympathetic pathway in the upper thoracic or cervical region. The sympathetic pathway ascends from the hypothalamus, descends through the brainstem and spinal cord, and then exits the spinal cord at the T1 level to innervate the eye. A C5 lesion is less likely to directly affect the sympathetic pathway at T1.\n\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** This is a direct consequence of the C5 lesion, which affects the corticospinal tract on the left side of the spinal cord. The corticospinal tract controls voluntary movement, and damage to it results in weakness on the opposite side of the body.\n\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** Pain pathways are different from motor pathways. While there may be some altered pain perception, it's not a direct or expected result of a C5 cord lesion.\n\nGiven the C5 lesion, the most likely finding is spastic paralysis on the contralateral side.\n\n## Final Answer\n\nA\n",
