      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue.

Dengue fever is characterized by high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain (often severe), rash, and sometimes bleeding problems. Dengue can cause elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), and a mild thrombocytopenia is common, but not always present.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?\n\nA) Clear cell adenocarcinoma\nB) Melanoma\nC) Botryoid sarcoma\nD) Verrucous carcinoma\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Analgesia is not typically associated with spinal cord lesions.\n\nGiven the high likelihood of a C5 lesion affecting the corticospinal tract, the most likely finding would be spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion. Horner's syndrome is also possible, but spastic paralysis is more directly linked to the lesion's location and the expected mechanism of injury.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding is spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion.\n\n**Answer: A**\nFinal Answer: A\n## Final Answer: A\n## Final Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer",

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?\n\nA) Clear cell adenocarcinoma\nB) Melanoma\nC) Botryoid sarcoma\nD) Verrucous carcinoma\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Analgesia is not typically associated with spinal cord lesions.\n\nGiven the high likelihood of a C5 lesion affecting the corticospinal tract, the most likely finding would be spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion. Horner's syndrome is also possible, but spastic paralysis is more directly linked to the lesion's location and the expected mechanism of injury.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding is spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion.\n\n**Answer: A**\nFinal Answer: A\n## Final Answer: A\n## Final Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer: A\nFinal Answer",

      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\n\nA) Affective symptoms\nB) Being single\nC) Male sex\nD) Negative symptoms\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4. Why each option is correct or incorrect\n\nAfter your analysis, select the single best answer from the provided options.\n\nProvide your reasoning, then state your final answer as a single letter.",

The neighbor's observation of a \"sudden change\" is important. The patient's current state of affairs is a result of a manic episode.\n\nThe key to understanding the prognosis is to determine which factor is most strongly associated with a better outcome in bipolar disorder.\n\nA) Affective symptoms: Affective symptoms, such as mood swings (mania/depression), are a core feature of bipolar disorder and are often associated with a poorer prognosis, especially if they are severe or chronic.\nB) Being single: Being single is not a direct predictor of prognosis.\nC) Male sex: There is no strong evidence to suggest that male sex is a predictor of prognosis in bipolar disorder.\nD) Negative symptoms: Negative symptoms (e.g., social withdrawal, lack of motivation, anhedonia) are generally associated with a poorer prognosis in bipolar disorder, as they can indicate a more severe or treatment-resistant form of the illness.\n\nThe question is asking for the predictor of good prognosis. Affective symptoms are a core feature of bipolar disorder, and can be associated with a poorer prognosis. Negative symptoms are associated with a poorer prognosis. This means that the best answer is a predictor of good prognosis.\n\nThe best answer is D.\n\n**Answer: D**\nFinal Answer: D\n## Explanation\n\nThe question asks for the predictor of good prognosis for the patient's condition.\n\n*   **Affective symptoms:** These are the mood swings (mania and depression) that are a hallmark of bipolar disorder. They are associated with a poorer prognosis, especially if they are severe or chronic.\n*   **Being single:** This is not a direct predictor of prognosis.\n*   **Male sex:** There is no strong evidence to suggest that male sex is a predictor of prognosis in bipolar disorder.\n*   **Negative symptoms:** These are symptoms like social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and anhedonia.
