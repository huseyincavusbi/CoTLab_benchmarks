      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms \u201cmost of the time.\u201d On physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature is 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

However, the significantly elevated AST/ALT in the patient's blood makes dengue fever more likely. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) typically presents with lymphadenopathy and fatigue, not the acute onset of fever, headache, and rash. Hepatitis A can cause similar symptoms, but the AST/ALT elevation is typically more pronounced, and the patient is not jaundiced.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?\n\nA) Clear cell adenocarcinoma\nB) Melanoma\nC) Botryoid sarcoma\nD) Verrucous carcinoma\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4.

      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 58-year-old white man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip.

In the cervical region, the sympathetic fibers run on the outside of the spinal cord, on the same side as the lesion. Therefore, a left-sided lesion would cause right-sided Horner's syndrome.\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** The corticospinal tract decussates (crosses over) in the lower medulla. Therefore, a lesion in the cervical spine would cause ipsilateral (same side) weakness, not contralateral (opposite side) weakness.\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** Analgesia is not directly related to the spinal cord or the corticospinal tract.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding is right-sided Horner's syndrome.\nFinal Answer: B\nReasoning:\nThe patient presents with a left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, which suggests a cervical spine injury. The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The question asks about the most likely additional finding.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord injuries. The corticospinal tract is affected, leading to weakness on the opposite side of the lesion (contralateral).\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic pathway. The sympathetic fibers travel on the outside of the spinal cord, on the same side as the lesion.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?\n\nA) Clear cell adenocarcinoma\nB) Melanoma\nC) Botryoid sarcoma\nD) Verrucous carcinoma\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0 C (99.2\u00b0 F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?\n\nA) Administer intravenous fludrocortisone\nB) Start him on androgen replacement treatment\nC) Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy\nD) Order an ACTH stimulation test\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

      "response": "\nFinal Answer: B\nReasoning: The scenario describes a cervical spinal cord lesion, most likely due to a herniated disc or other compressive pathology. The left-sided weakness is consistent with the lesion being in the left hemicord. The question asks what other finding will most likely be seen.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord injuries, as the corticospinal tracts are affected.\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results from damage to the sympathetic pathway. In the cervical region, the sympathetic fibers run on the outside of the spinal cord, on the same side as the lesion. Therefore, a left-sided lesion would cause right-sided Horner's syndrome.\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** The corticospinal tract decussates (crosses over) in the lower medulla. Therefore, a lesion in the cervical spine would cause ipsilateral (same side) weakness, not contralateral (opposite side) weakness.\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** Analgesia is not directly related to the spinal cord or the corticospinal tract.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding is right-sided Horner's syndrome.\nFinal Answer: B\nReasoning:\nThe patient presents with a left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, which suggests a cervical spine injury. The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The question asks about the most likely additional finding.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord injuries. The corticospinal tract is affected, leading to weakness on the opposite side of the lesion (contralateral).\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic pathway. The sympathetic fibers travel on the outside of the spinal cord, on the same side as the lesion. Therefore, a left-sided lesion would cause right-sided Horner's syndrome.\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** The corticospinal tract decussates (crosses over) in the lower medulla.

      "reasoning": "\nFinal Answer: B\nReasoning: The scenario describes a cervical spinal cord lesion, most likely due to a herniated disc or other compressive pathology. The left-sided weakness is consistent with the lesion being in the left hemicord. The question asks what other finding will most likely be seen.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord injuries, as the corticospinal tracts are affected.\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results from damage to the sympathetic pathway. In the cervical region, the sympathetic fibers run on the outside of the spinal cord, on the same side as the lesion. Therefore, a left-sided lesion would cause right-sided Horner's syndrome.\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** The corticospinal tract decussates (crosses over) in the lower medulla. Therefore, a lesion in the cervical spine would cause ipsilateral (same side) weakness, not contralateral (opposite side) weakness.\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** Analgesia is not directly related to the spinal cord or the corticospinal tract.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding is right-sided Horner's syndrome.\nFinal Answer: B\nReasoning:\nThe patient presents with a left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, which suggests a cervical spine injury. The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The question asks about the most likely additional finding.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord injuries. The corticospinal tract is affected, leading to weakness on the opposite side of the lesion (contralateral).\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic pathway.

      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\n\nA) Affective symptoms\nB) Being single\nC) Male sex\nD) Negative symptoms\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully. Consider:\n1. Key clinical findings and patient presentation\n2. Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms\n3. Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines\n4. Why each option is correct or incorrect\n\nAfter your analysis, select the single best answer from the provided options.\n\nState your final answer as a single letter, followed by your reasoning.\n\nProvide ONLY the final answer letter.
