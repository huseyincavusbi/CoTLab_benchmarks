The spindle cells have elongated nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are rare. No necrosis or vascular invasion is identified. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. The tumor cells are positive for CD34 and smooth muscle actin (SMA), and negative for desmin, cytokeratin (CK), and S100.\n**Diagnosis:** Benign vascular proliferation, consistent with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or possibly a benign vascular tumor such as pulmonary myoid hamartoma. Given the storiform pattern and IHC profile (CD34+, SMA+, desmin-, CK-, S100-), a benign vascular tumor is favored.\n**Comment:** The differential diagnosis includes other spindle cell lesions, but the IHC profile strongly favors a benign vascular proliferation.

The femoral component shows moderate wear on the articulating surface. The tibial component shows some wear. The polyethylene insert shows significant wear, particularly on the medial condyle. There is evidence of loosening around the femoral stem. There are multiple fragments of bone and soft tissue adherent to the components. Several small, dark brown, granular deposits are noted on the surface of the polyethylene insert and around the femoral stem. These deposits are suspicious for metal debris.\n\n**Microscopic Description:**\nSections show fragments of bone and soft tissue. There is evidence of chronic inflammation with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. There is also evidence of foreign body reaction to polyethylene particles. There is moderate osteolysis surrounding the femoral stem. There is evidence of metal debris deposition in the soft tissue and bone. The metal debris is identified by polarized light microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) as cobalt-chromium alloy.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nRevision Total Knee Arthroplasty Specimen, Right Knee:\n1.
