The amputation is at the level of the mid-thigh. The specimen includes skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, muscle, bone, and vessels. The skin overlying the distal aspect of the thigh is ulcerated and erythematous. There is a large, firm, infiltrative mass involving the quadriceps femoris muscle, measuring 12 x 10 x 8 cm.
