The tumor consists of nests and cords of large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. The cells exhibit moderate pleomorphism and frequent mitotic figures. Tumor cells are arranged in a papillary pattern in some areas. There is associated necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. Tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK7, and TTF-1. Tumor cells are negative for CK20, p63, and p40.

Patient underwent bronchoscopy with biopsy.\n\n**GROSS DESCRIPTION:** Received in formalin is a core biopsy specimen measuring 1.5 x 0.3 cm. The core is tan-white and firm.\n\n**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:** The biopsy core shows fragments of lung parenchyma with entrapped respiratory epithelium. The tumor consists of nests and cords of large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. The cells exhibit moderate pleomorphism and frequent mitotic figures. Tumor cells are arranged in a papillary pattern in some areas. There is associated necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. Tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK7, and TTF-1. Tumor cells are negative for CK20, p63, and p40. IHC for PD-L1 is positive in approximately 40% of tumor cells.\n\n**DIAGNOSIS:** Lung, right upper lobe, core biopsy: Large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 positive (40%).\n\n**COMMENT:** The immunohistochemical profile (CK7+, TTF-1+, CK20-, p63-, p40-) is consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma, although the morphology described as \"large cell carcinoma\" can sometimes overlap with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The papillary architecture observed supports adenocarcinoma. Given the prominent nucleoli and moderate pleomorphism, large cell carcinoma remains a possibility, but the IHC profile strongly favors adenocarcinoma.\n\n**Generated Report:**\n\n**CLINICAL HISTORY:** 65-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease presents with progressive shortness of breath and cough.
