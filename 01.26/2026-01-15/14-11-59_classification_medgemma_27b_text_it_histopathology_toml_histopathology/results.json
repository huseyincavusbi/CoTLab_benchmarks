The specimen weighs 45 grams. The pleural surface is smooth and glistening. The cut surface reveals a firm, white-tan, spiculated mass measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm, located 2 cm from the nearest pleural surface. The mass is focally hemorrhagic.

The specimen consists of multiple irregular fragments of lung parenchyma, the largest measuring 3.5 cm. The pleural surface is unremarkable. The cut surfaces reveal multiple gray-white nodules, ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm, scattered throughout the parenchyma.

The background stroma shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The small round blue cells are positive for CD45, CD20, and PAX5, consistent with a B-cell lymphoma. The small round blue cells are negative for CD3, CD5, and Cyclin D1.

The specimen weighs 45 grams. The pleural surface is smooth and glistening. The cut surface reveals a firm, white-tan, spiculated mass measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm, located 2 cm from the nearest pleural surface. The mass is focally hemorrhagic. There is no involvement of the visceral pleura.
