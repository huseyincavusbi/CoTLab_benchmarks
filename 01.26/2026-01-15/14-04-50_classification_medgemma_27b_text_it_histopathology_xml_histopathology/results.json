The specimen is entirely submitted in A1-A4.\n\n**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**\nSections show epidermis with focal spongiosis and mild acanthosis. The papillary dermis shows edema and a sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes. The reticular dermis shows a well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated dermal infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional eosinophils. The infiltrate obscures and replaces the adnexal structures. The infiltrate extends to the deep margin. The features are consistent with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.\n\n**DIAGNOSIS:**\nCutaneous B-cell lymphoma.\n---\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe generated report is identical to the original case findings in both the gross description, microscopic description, and diagnosis.

The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette.\n\n**Microscopic Description:** Histologic sections show a moderately cellular infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes within the dermis. These lymphocytes are predominantly small to medium-sized, with irregular nuclear contours, clumped chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are infrequent. There is associated epidermotropism, with lymphocytes infiltrating the epidermis, forming Pautrier's microabscesses. The overlying epidermis shows mild acanthosis and parakeratosis.
