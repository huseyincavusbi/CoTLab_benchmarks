The mass weighs 25 grams. The mass is firm, lobulated, and has a partially ulcerated surface. The cut surface is tan-brown, solid, and contains multiple small cystic spaces. On the cut surface, there is a 1.5 x 1.0 cm area of hemorrhage. There is a 1.0 cm area of necrosis. The mass involves the gingiva, alveolar ridge, and extends into the underlying soft tissue. The specimen is entirely received.\n\n**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**\nSections show a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm composed of nests and cords of tumor cells infiltrating the underlying stroma. The tumor cells are large, pleomorphic, with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are numerous, including atypical forms. There is extensive necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor cells invade the underlying bone and soft tissue. The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) and negative for desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Immunohistochemical stains are positive for p63 and negative for p40. The tumor cells are positive for TTF-1. The tumor cells are negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin. The tumor cells are negative for S100 protein.

The TTF-1 positivity suggests a possible lung primary, but the clinical presentation and morphology are more consistent with a primary gingival carcinoma.

The mass weighs 25 grams. The mass is firm, lobulated, and has a partially ulcerated surface. The cut surface is tan-brown, solid, and contains multiple small cystic spaces. On the cut surface, there is a 1.5 x 1.0 cm area of hemorrhage. There is a 1.0 cm area of necrosis. The mass involves the gingiva, alveolar ridge, and extends into the underlying soft tissue. The specimen is entirely received.\n\n**MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:**\nSections show a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm composed of nests and cords of tumor cells infiltrating the underlying stroma. The tumor cells are large, pleomorphic, with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are numerous, including atypical forms. There is extensive necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor cells invade the underlying bone and soft tissue. The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin (CK) and negative for desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA).

The tumor cells are negative for CD45.\n\n**DIAGNOSIS:**\nPoorly differentiated carcinoma, likely primary of the gingiva, with extensive necrosis and hemorrhage.\n\n**COMMENT:**\nThe immunohistochemical profile (CK+, p63+, p40-, TTF-1+, synaptophysin-, chromogranin-, S100-, CD45-) is consistent with a poorly differentiated carcinoma. The TTF-1 positivity suggests a possible lung primary, but the clinical presentation and morphology are more consistent with a primary gingival carcinoma. Further investigation may be warranted to rule out metastatic disease.\n\n---\n**Generated Report:**\n\n**GROSS DESCRIPTION:**\nThe specimen received is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm, tan-brown, irregular mass weighing 25 grams.

Moderate chronic inflammation, characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells, is noted in the interstitium and around the bronchioles. Neutrophils are scattered throughout. Organizing pneumonia is present, showing plugs of granulation tissue within the alveolar ducts and alveoli. No granulomas or malignancy were identified.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n1.  Chronic bronchitis with organizing pneumonia.\n\n---\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe generated report accurately reflects the original case findings. The gross description matches the original, including the dimensions and appearance of the specimen. The microscopic description correctly identifies the key features: lung parenchyma, bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar spaces, moderate chronic inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells) in the interstitium and around bronchioles, scattered neutrophils, and organizing pneumonia (granulation tissue plugs). Importantly, it also correctly notes the absence of granulomas and malignancy. The diagnosis matches the original.\n\n**Score: 2**\n---",
