Analysis of osseous microstructural variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.933, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.950, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and by dark field OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.667, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2\u00a0mm.

Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category. All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded. A total of 103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of smoking (42%).

Seventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic inflammation. One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis.

Nevertheless, cystic lesions, which correspond to the previous image of globulomaxillary cysts, do still occur in daily practice. This raises the question to which entities pathological processes in this particular region actually belong to. In a retrospective study, 17 cases (12 men and 5 women, 12-59\u00a0years old) of primarily diagnosed globulomaxillary cysts are analysed according to clinical, radiological and histological aspects, catamnestic processed and assigned to a new entity. The results are compared with the international literature and draws conclusions on the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Seven lateral periodontal cysts, four radicular cysts, two keratocystic odontogenic tumours, one adenomatoid odontogenic tumour, one periapical granuloma, one residual cyst and one undefined jaw cyst were determined.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to prevent heterotopic ossifications effectively, however gastrointestinal complaints are reported frequently. In this study, we investigated whether etoricoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that produces fewer gastrointestinal side effects, is an effective alternative for the prevention of heterotopic ossification. We investigated the effectiveness of oral etoricoxib 90 mg for seven days in a prospective two-stage study design for phase-2 clinical trials in a small sample of patients (n\u2009=\u200942). A cemented primary total hip arthroplasty was implanted for osteoarthritis. Six months after surgery, heterotopic ossification was determined on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs using the Brooker classification. No heterotopic ossification was found in 62 % of the patients that took etoricoxib; 31 % of the patients had Brooker grade 1 and 7 % Brooker grade 2 ossification.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood cycle as the unit of analysis. After controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior.

Analysis of osseous microstructural variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.933, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.950, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and by dark field OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.667, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2\u00a0mm. The high negative correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated less than 0.3\u00a0mm each other.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons.

Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood cycle as the unit of analysis. After controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts.

Retrospective cohort from a single center in 2009-2010 of singleton, term live births. CD rates were compared for women with and without US-EFW within 1 month of delivery and adjusted for potential confounders. Of the 2329 women in our cohort, 50.2% had US-EFW within 1 month of delivery. CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW (15.7% vs 10.2%; P<.001); after we controlled for confounders, US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9). The risk increased when US-EFW was>3500 g (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7).\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the research question and abstract context carefully.\n2.

In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 million. From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 1996. Primary endpoint was survival. The survival rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for all gynaecological sites combined.

Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period. NCT00816829. As this was an exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2))<90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events per hour.
