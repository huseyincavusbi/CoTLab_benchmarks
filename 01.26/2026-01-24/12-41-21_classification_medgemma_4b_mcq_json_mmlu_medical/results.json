Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease.

This indicates a type of fracture that is not fully displaced.\n\n*   **Closed fracture:** This means the skin is intact, and there is no open wound. This aligns with the clinical findings.\n*   **Greenstick fracture:** This is a type of incomplete fracture where the bone is bent and not broken. This aligns with the description of the radius being bent.\n*   **Complex fracture:** This is a fracture with multiple fragments. While the fracture is in the radius, the description doesn't mention multiple fragments.\n*   **Comminuted fracture:** This is a fracture with multiple fragments. Similar to a complex fracture, this is not described in the clinical findings.\n*   **Compound fracture:** This is a fracture with an open wound. This is not consistent with the intact skin.\n*   **Transverse fracture:** This is a fracture that is straight across the bone. This is not the description of the radius being bent.\n*   **Open fracture:** This is a fracture with an open wound. This is not consistent with the intact skin.\n*   **Spiral fracture:** This is a fracture that spirals around the bone.

This is a general statement about dehydration and doesn't specifically address hypernatremia.\nB) Water intake is more than is needed to maintain balance. This is incorrect; hypernatremia is characterized by a *lack* of water relative to sodium.\nC) Blood volume is lost due to trauma or burns. This describes hypovolemic shock, which can cause hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.\nD) Blood volume is lost due to surgery. This also describes hypovolemic shock, which can cause hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.\n\nThe correct definition of hypernatraemic dehydration is water intake is less than is needed to maintain balance.\n\n## Answer\n\nA\n## Reasoning\n\nHypernatraemic dehydration is defined as a state of dehydration with an elevated sodium level. This occurs when the body loses more water than sodium, or when water intake is insufficient to compensate for sodium losses. This is not related to trauma, surgery, or increased water intake.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"A\", \"reasoning\": \"Hypernatraemic dehydration is defined as a state of dehydration with an elevated sodium level.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Muscle glycogen phosphorylase breaks down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate for use in glycolysis.\n\n*   **B) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles:** This statement is true. Type I muscle fibres (slow-twitch) are primarily used for endurance activities and are abundant in the leg muscles of elite endurance runners.\n\n*   **C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration:** This statement is true.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nWhich of the following statements is true of air as compared to water?\n\nA) Air provides more physical support.\nB) Air has a higher O2 concentration.\nC) Air offers more resistance to motion.\nD) Air has more thermal inertia.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.
