Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue.

The wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is suggestive of *Staphylococcus aureus*. The failure to improve with dicloxacillin suggests a resistant strain of *S. aureus* or a different organism.\n\n*   **A) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane:** This is characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria, not Gram-positive bacteria like *S. aureus*.\n*   **B) Ability to cleave \u03b2-lactam rings:** This is the mechanism of action of penicillinase, an enzyme produced by some *S. aureus* strains that can inactivate penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. This is a very common mechanism of resistance to dicloxacillin.\n*   **C) Development of efflux pumps:** Efflux pumps can contribute to antibiotic resistance by pumping the drug out of the bacterial cell. While efflux pumps can be involved in resistance, they are less common and less likely to be the primary reason for failure with dicloxacillin compared to penicillinase.\n*   **D) Adaptation in binding proteins:** While some bacteria can modify their binding proteins to evade antibiotics, this is not a common or well-established mechanism of resistance to dicloxacillin in *S. aureus*.\n\nThe most likely explanation for the failure of dicloxacillin to treat the infection is the production of penicillinase by the *S. aureus* strain.

The pain varies in location and intensity. She also has joint stiffness in the morning and reports fatigue throughout the day that she attributes to not sleeping well. She reports a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. Her bowel habits are unchanged but she often feels bloated. She has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her medications include propranolol and sumatriptan. She appears healthy.

This clinical picture strongly suggests a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The normal laboratory studies (including TSH) and the absence of other concerning findings (e.g., anemia, elevated inflammatory markers) further support this diagnosis. The medication list (propranolol and sumatriptan) is less relevant to the diagnosis.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A) Temazepam:** Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used for insomnia. While the patient reports fatigue, the primary issue is the widespread pain and other symptoms. Treating the insomnia alone would not address the underlying problem. It could also have adverse effects in a patient who does not have a clear indication for its use.\n\n*   **B) Vitamin B12:** Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including paresthesias and fatigue. However, the patient's normal MCV makes B12 deficiency less likely. The clinical picture is more consistent with fibromyalgia.\n\n*   **C) Amitriptyline:** Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is effective for treating fibromyalgia. It works by modulating pain pathways and improving sleep. It is a well-established treatment option for this condition.\n\n*   **D) Methotrexate:** Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is not typically used for fibromyalgia. It can have significant side effects and is not a first-line treatment.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate therapy is Amitriptyline.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"The patient's symptoms (chronic, symmetric, variable muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, paresthesias) are highly suggestive of fibromyalgia.

This strongly suggests cervical spinal cord compression. The question asks about the most likely finding.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord compression. The lesion affects the corticospinal tract, leading to weakness and spasticity on the contralateral side.\n\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results from disruption of the sympathetic pathway. In this case, the lesion is on the left, so right-sided Horner's syndrome is possible, but less likely than spastic paralysis.\n\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** This is the expected finding in cervical cord compression. The corticospinal tract crosses over in the medulla, so a lesion on one side will cause weakness on the opposite side of the body.\n\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** This is not a typical finding in spinal cord compression. Analgesia is generally reduced, not increased, due to the lesion.\n\nGiven the lesion is on the left, the contralateral corticospinal tract involvement is the most likely finding.

The neighbor's comment about the patient's sudden change in behavior further supports this. Given the patient's age (29 years old) and the acute onset of symptoms, we need to consider potential diagnoses that are more likely to have a better prognosis in this age group.\n\n*   **A) Affective symptoms:** Affective symptoms, such as depression or mania, can be a part of many psychiatric conditions. However, they are not always a good predictor of prognosis. For example, someone with a severe depressive episode might have a poorer prognosis than someone with a mild manic episode.\n\n*   **B) Being single:** Being single is not a direct predictor of prognosis in psychiatric disorders. While social support can be important, it's not a reliable indicator of how well someone will respond to treatment or how long they will last.\n\n*   **C) Male sex:** Male sex is not a strong predictor of prognosis in psychiatric disorders.\n\n*   **D) Negative symptoms:** Negative symptoms, such as blunted affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation, are often associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These symptoms can be more difficult to treat and can lead to a more chronic and debilitating course.\n\nGiven the acute onset of symptoms and the patient's age, a possible diagnosis could be a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a first episode of psychosis.

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\n\nA) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\nB) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.\nC) A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.\nD) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?\n\nA) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane\nB) Ability to cleave \u03b2-lactam rings\nC) Development of efflux pumps\nD) Adaptation in binding proteins\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

      "response": "\n## Reasoning\n\nThe patient has a surgical site infection (SSI) that is not responding to dicloxacillin. The wound culture shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is suggestive of *Staphylococcus aureus*. The failure to improve with dicloxacillin suggests a resistant strain of *S. aureus* or a different organism.\n\n*   **A) Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane:** This is characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria, not Gram-positive bacteria like *S. aureus*.\n*   **B) Ability to cleave \u03b2-lactam rings:** This is the mechanism of action of penicillinase, an enzyme produced by some *S. aureus* strains that can inactivate penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. This is a very common mechanism of resistance to dicloxacillin.\n*   **C) Development of efflux pumps:** Efflux pumps can contribute to antibiotic resistance by pumping the drug out of the bacterial cell. While efflux pumps can be involved in resistance, they are less common and less likely to be the primary reason for failure with dicloxacillin compared to penicillinase.\n*   **D) Adaptation in binding proteins:** While some bacteria can modify their binding proteins to evade antibiotics, this is not a common or well-established mechanism of resistance to dicloxacillin in *S. aureus*.\n\nThe most likely explanation for the failure of dicloxacillin to treat the infection is the production of penicillinase by the *S. aureus* strain. Penicillinase cleaves the \u03b2-lactam ring of the dicloxacillin molecule, rendering it ineffective.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"B\", \"reasoning\": \"The most likely explanation for the failure of dicloxacillin to treat the infection is the production of penicillinase by the *S. aureus* strain.

The medication list (propranolol and sumatriptan) is less relevant to the diagnosis.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A) Temazepam:** Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used for insomnia. While the patient reports fatigue, the primary issue is the widespread pain and other symptoms. Treating the insomnia alone would not address the underlying problem. It could also have adverse effects in a patient who does not have a clear indication for its use.\n\n*   **B) Vitamin B12:** Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including paresthesias and fatigue. However, the patient's normal MCV makes B12 deficiency less likely. The clinical picture is more consistent with fibromyalgia.\n\n*   **C) Amitriptyline:** Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is effective for treating fibromyalgia. It works by modulating pain pathways and improving sleep. It is a well-established treatment option for this condition.\n\n*   **D) Methotrexate:** Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is not typically used for fibromyalgia. It can have significant side effects and is not a first-line treatment.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate therapy is Amitriptyline.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"The patient's symptoms (chronic, symmetric, variable muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, paresthesias) are highly suggestive of fibromyalgia.

This strongly suggests cervical spinal cord compression. The question asks about the most likely finding.\n\n*   **A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion:** This is a common finding in cervical cord compression. The lesion affects the corticospinal tract, leading to weakness and spasticity on the contralateral side.\n\n*   **B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome:** Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results from disruption of the sympathetic pathway. In this case, the lesion is on the left, so right-sided Horner's syndrome is possible, but less likely than spastic paralysis.\n\n*   **C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement:** This is the expected finding in cervical cord compression. The corticospinal tract crosses over in the medulla, so a lesion on one side will cause weakness on the opposite side of the body.\n\n*   **D) Right-sided analgesia:** This is not a typical finding in spinal cord compression. Analgesia is generally reduced, not increased, due to the lesion.\n\nGiven the lesion is on the left, the contralateral corticospinal tract involvement is the most likely finding.

His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help.

The neighbor's comment about the patient's sudden change in behavior further supports this. Given the patient's age (29 years old) and the acute onset of symptoms, we need to consider potential diagnoses that are more likely to have a better prognosis in this age group.\n\n*   **A) Affective symptoms:** Affective symptoms, such as depression or mania, can be a part of many psychiatric conditions. However, they are not always a good predictor of prognosis. For example, someone with a severe depressive episode might have a poorer prognosis than someone with a mild manic episode.\n\n*   **B) Being single:** Being single is not a direct predictor of prognosis in psychiatric disorders. While social support can be important, it's not a reliable indicator of how well someone will respond to treatment or how long they will last.\n\n*   **C) Male sex:** Male sex is not a strong predictor of prognosis in psychiatric disorders.\n\n*   **D) Negative symptoms:** Negative symptoms, such as blunted affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation, are often associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These symptoms can be more difficult to treat and can lead to a more chronic and debilitating course.\n\nGiven the acute onset of symptoms and the patient's age, a possible diagnosis could be a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a first episode of psychosis. In these conditions, the presence of negative symptoms is often associated with a poorer prognosis, while the absence or presence of positive symptoms can vary depending on the specific disorder and the individual's response to treatment.\n\nIn the context of this question, the most likely answer is **D) Negative symptoms**.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"D\", \"reasoning\": \"Negative symptoms, such as blunted affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation, are often associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

The decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, and altered mental status further support the severity of the condition.\n\nThe question asks which parameter is most likely decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult.\n\nA) Systemic vascular resistance: In cirrhosis, SVR is typically *increased* due to the body's compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure in the face of decreased cardiac output.\n\nB) Fractional tissue oxygen extraction: This parameter is *increased* in cirrhosis. The liver's ability to extract oxygen from the blood is impaired, leading to increased extraction in other tissues. This is a key component of the hyperdynamic circulation seen in cirrhosis.\n\nC) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity: Baroreceptor sensitivity is *decreased* in cirrhosis. The chronically elevated SVR and other compensatory mechanisms blunt the baroreceptor response, making it harder for the body to regulate blood pressure.\n\nD) Cardiac inotropy: Cardiac inotropy (the heart's ability to contract) is *increased* in early stages of cirrhosis due to the body's attempt to compensate for the decreased cardiac output.\n\nTherefore, the most likely decreased parameter in this patient is carotid baroreceptor firing activity.\n\n## JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"C\", \"reasoning\": \"The patient's presentation strongly suggests cirrhosis and variceal bleeding.

The symptoms are relatively acute (3 months).\n\n*   **B) A septal hematoma causing a perforation:** A septal hematoma is a collection of blood within the nasal septum. While it can cause a septal perforation, this is a more acute and painful presentation, not typically presenting after 3 months.\n\n*   **C) A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow:** A deviated septum can cause chronic nasal obstruction and, after correction (e.g., rhinoplasty), could theoretically result in altered nasal airflow. However, the *whistling* sound is more specific to a narrowed or obstructed airway.\n\n*   **D) Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow:** The columellar show refers to the prominence of the junction of the nose and upper lip. Excessive columellar show does not typically cause a whistling noise.\n\nConsidering the timeframe (3 months) and the specific finding of a whistling noise, the most likely cause is a subtle issue with the nasal airway that has now become more apparent after the surgery.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease.

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\n\nA) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\nB) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.\nC) A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.\nD) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.
