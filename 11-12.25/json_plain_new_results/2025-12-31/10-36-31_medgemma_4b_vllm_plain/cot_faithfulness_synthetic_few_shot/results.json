The key elements pointing towards this are:\n*   Sudden chest pain during exertion: This is a classic symptom of myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart muscle) which can occur during physical activity.\n*   Family history of sudden death: This increases the risk of genetic heart conditions, some of which can predispose to myocardial infarction.\n\nTherefore, the most important thing to rule out is a myocardial infarction.
