This condition is often associated with ptosis (drooping eyelids) and diplopia (double vision), which worsen with fatigue and improve with rest. The symptoms tend to be more pronounced at the end of the day because muscle activity increases with prolonged use, leading to depletion of the available acetylcholine receptors.\n\nTherefore, ptosis and diplopia that worsen at the end of the day are suggestive of myasthenia gravis.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{True}$\nQuestion: The most common cause of acute kidney injury in a patient with diabetes mellitus is\n\nAnswer: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)\n\nExplanation: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in diabetic patients is most commonly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

While diastolic heart failure can also cause shortness of breath and orthopnea, the echocardiogram findings would typically show normal or near-normal systolic function with evidence of impaired diastolic filling (e.g., increased left atrial size, abnormal mitral inflow patterns).\n\n*   **Arrhythmia:** Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) can cause shortness of breath, but they do not typically cause left ventricular dilation or a reduced ejection fraction unless the arrhythmia is severe and leads to cardiomyopathy.\n\n*   **Valvular Heart Disease:** Valvular heart disease can cause shortness of breath and heart failure, but the echocardiogram would typically show evidence of a valve abnormality (e.g., stenosis, regurgitation).\n\n*   **",

Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\n\nBronchiectasis, on the other hand, is a chronic condition where the bronchi are permanently dilated and damaged, leading to a buildup of mucus and increased risk of infection.

The most important consideration regarding the timing of antibiotic administration is to start the antibiotics as soon as possible after obtaining a sample for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nExplanation: While prompt antibiotic administration is crucial in meningitis, the timing of antibiotic administration in relation to CSF analysis is not as critical as the timing of antibiotic administration itself.

      "direct_response": "\n\nAnswer: False\nFinal Answer: False\nExplanation: A positive Romberg sign indicates impaired proprioception. Sensory ataxia is caused by impaired sensory input to the cerebellum, which results in ataxia (imbalance). A positive Romberg sign indicates that the patient can maintain balance with eyes open but loses balance with eyes closed, suggesting a problem with proprioception (sense of body position) rather than cerebellar function. Therefore, a positive Romberg sign is indicative of sensory ataxia, not cerebellar ataxia.\nFinal",

      "cot_response": " True. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that binds to the TSH receptor, leading to overproduction of thyroid hormones and the development of exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs).\n\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of worsening fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath. Physical exam reveals a pericardial friction rub. Labs show elevated BNP and troponin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAnswer: Acute pericarditis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath), physical exam finding (pericardial friction rub), and lab results (elevated BNP and troponin) are highly suggestive of acute pericarditis. The pericardial friction rub is a classic sign of inflammation of the pericardium. Elevated BNP and troponin can be seen in pericarditis due to inflammation and potential myocardial involvement.\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of gradually worsening joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning. She also reports dry eyes and dry mouth. Physical exam reveals synovitis in multiple joints. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAnswer: Rheumatoid arthritis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms (joint pain and stiffness, especially in the morning), physical exam finding (synovitis), and symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth) are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The dry eyes and dry mouth suggest secondary Sjogren's syndrome, which is often associated with RA.\n\nQuestion: A 30-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, she has a stiff neck and photophobia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAnswer: Meningitis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms (sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting), physical exam findings (stiff neck and photophobia) are classic signs of meningitis. The sudden onset and severity of symptoms suggest a bacterial or viral etiology.\n\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man presents with a persistent cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

This condition is often associated with ptosis (drooping eyelids) and diplopia (double vision), which worsen with fatigue and improve with rest. The symptoms tend to be more pronounced at the end of the day because muscle activity increases with prolonged use, leading to depletion of the available acetylcholine receptors.\n\nTherefore, ptosis and diplopia that worsen at the end of the day are suggestive of myasthenia gravis.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{True}$\nQuestion: The most common cause of acute kidney injury in a patient with diabetes mellitus is\n\nAnswer: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)\n\nExplanation: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in diabetic patients is most commonly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

While diastolic heart failure can also cause shortness of breath and orthopnea, the echocardiogram findings would typically show normal or near-normal systolic function with evidence of impaired diastolic filling (e.g., increased left atrial size, abnormal mitral inflow patterns).\n\n*   **Arrhythmia:** Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) can cause shortness of breath, but they do not typically cause left ventricular dilation or a reduced ejection fraction unless the arrhythmia is severe and leads to cardiomyopathy.\n\n*   **Valvular Heart Disease:** Valvular heart disease can cause shortness of breath and heart failure, but the echocardiogram would typically show evidence of a valve abnormality (e.g., stenosis, regurgitation).\n\n*   **",

Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\n\nBronchiectasis, on the other hand, is a chronic condition where the bronchi are permanently dilated and damaged, leading to a buildup of mucus and increased risk of infection.

The most important consideration regarding the timing of antibiotic administration is to start the antibiotics as soon as possible after obtaining a sample for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.\n\nAnswer: False\n\nExplanation: While prompt antibiotic administration is crucial in meningitis, the timing of antibiotic administration in relation to CSF analysis is not as critical as the timing of antibiotic administration itself.

      "direct_response": "\n\nAnswer: False\nFinal Answer: False\nExplanation: A positive Romberg sign indicates impaired proprioception. Sensory ataxia is caused by impaired sensory input to the cerebellum, which results in ataxia (imbalance). A positive Romberg sign indicates that the patient can maintain balance with eyes open but loses balance with eyes closed, suggesting a problem with proprioception (sense of body position) rather than cerebellar function. Therefore, a positive Romberg sign is indicative of sensory ataxia, not cerebellar ataxia.\nFinal",
