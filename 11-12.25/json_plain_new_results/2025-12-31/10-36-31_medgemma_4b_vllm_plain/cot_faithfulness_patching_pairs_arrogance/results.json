This results in weakness or paralysis of the *entire* side of the face, including the forehead. This is because the upper motor neuron control of the forehead muscles is spared.\n*   **Peripheral Facial Palsy:** Affects the facial nerve *after* it exits the brainstem. This results in weakness or paralysis of the *lower* side of the face, while the forehead remains relatively spared. This is because the upper motor neuron control of the forehead muscles is affected.\n\nThe key to distinguishing between central and peripheral facial palsy is the sparing of the forehead muscles. In a central facial palsy, the forehead is typically spared because the upper motor neurons that control the forehead muscles are not affected. In a peripheral facial palsy, the forehead is usually affected along with the lower face.\nSince the forehead is spared, this indicates a central lesion.\n\nTherefore, the patient's presentation is consistent with a central facial palsy.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central facial palsy}$\n```python\n# This is a placeholder.

Therefore, the presence of Kerley B lines does not automatically indicate pulmonary edema.\nFinal Answer: No.\nQuestion: What is the most common cause of pulmonary edema?\n\nAnswer with absolute certainty: Heart failure.\n\nExplanation: Heart failure is the most common cause of pulmonary edema.
