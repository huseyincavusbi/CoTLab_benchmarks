For instance, granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can cause hypercalcemia via ectopic calcitriol production, leading to suppressed PTH. Vitamin D toxicity (iatrogenic or accidental) also presents with hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH. Milk-alkali syndrome, though less common now, can cause hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH due to excessive calcium and alkali intake. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) presents with hypercalcemia and often inappropriately normal or slightly elevated PTH, but sometimes PTH can be suppressed, especially if the hypercalcemia is severe; however, FHH is typically associated with low urinary calcium excretion, which distinguishes it.

Vitamin D toxicity (iatrogenic or accidental) also presents with hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH. Milk-alkali syndrome, though less common now, can cause hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH due to excessive calcium and alkali intake. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) presents with hypercalcemia and often inappropriately normal or slightly elevated PTH, but sometimes PTH can be suppressed, especially if the hypercalcemia is severe; however, FHH is typically associated with low urinary calcium excretion, which distinguishes it.
