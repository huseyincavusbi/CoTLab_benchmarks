In a central facial palsy (e.g., stroke), the upper face is typically affected, while the lower face is spared. This is because the upper face receives bilateral innervation from the motor cortex, whereas the lower face receives primarily contralateral innervation. Therefore, a lesion in the motor cortex will affect the upper face more than the lower face.\n\nIn contrast, a peripheral",
