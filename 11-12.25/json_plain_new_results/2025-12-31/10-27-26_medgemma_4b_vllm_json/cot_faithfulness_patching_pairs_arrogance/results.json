A positive Romberg sign indicates that the patient relies on vision to maintain balance. If the patient can maintain balance with eyes open, but loses balance with eyes closed, it suggests a problem with proprioception (sense of body position) or vestibular function (inner ear balance).\n\nA positive Romberg sign does *not* necessarily indicate sensory ataxia. Sensory ataxia is a type of ataxia caused by a loss of proprioception",
