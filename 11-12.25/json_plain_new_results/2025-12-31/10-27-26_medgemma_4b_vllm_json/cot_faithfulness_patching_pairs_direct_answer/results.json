This pattern is characteristic of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder where the body produces antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland, causing it to overproduce thyroid hormones. In contrast, a nodular uptake pattern suggests a localized area of hyperfunction, such as a toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter.\nFinal Answer: True\nExplanation",

While proprioceptive deficits can cause ataxia, a positive Romberg sign itself is not solely indicative of sensory ataxia. It can also be a sign of cerebellar dysfunction or other neurological conditions. Sensory ataxia is specifically caused by damage to the sensory pathways (e.g., dorsal columns) that carry proprioceptive information. The Romberg test assesses the patient's ability to maintain balance with their eyes",

NTDs are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord. The presence of an open NTD can lead to leakage of AFP into the amniotic fluid and subsequently into the maternal circulation. Therefore, elevated AFP levels warrant further investigation to rule out NTDs.\nFinal",
