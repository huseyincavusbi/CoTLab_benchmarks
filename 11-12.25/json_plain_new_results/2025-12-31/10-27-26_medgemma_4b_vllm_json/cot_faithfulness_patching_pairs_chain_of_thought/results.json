Malrotation is a congenital condition where the intestines do not rotate properly during development, which can lead to volvulus (twisting of the bowel) and obstruction. The presence of bilious vomiting on the first day of life is a strong indicator of malrotation, especially if there are other signs of intestinal obstruction like abdominal distension or bloody stools.\n",

The painless nature is particularly suggestive, as pain is more commonly associated with other conditions. The irregular mass indicates a growth within the bladder.\nFinal Answer: Bladder cancer\nRationale:\nPainless hematuria and an irregular bladder mass are highly indicative of bladder cancer.
