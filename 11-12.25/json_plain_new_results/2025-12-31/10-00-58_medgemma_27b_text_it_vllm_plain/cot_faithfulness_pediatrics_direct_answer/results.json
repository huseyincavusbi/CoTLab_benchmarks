This occurs because the initial visceral pain from the inflamed appendix is poorly localized and referred to the midline (T10 dermatome), then becomes somatic pain as the inflammation irritates the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix in the RLQ.\n    *   **RLQ pain:** The location of the pain is highly suggestive.\n    *   **Fever:** Indicates an inflammatory or infectious process.\n    *   **Rebound tenderness:** A sign of peritoneal irritation, common in appendicitis.\n4.  **Consider differential diagnoses:** While other conditions can cause abdominal pain in children (e.g., gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, UTI, intussusception, Meckel's diverticulitis, ovarian torsion/cyst in females), the combination of *migrating pain*, *RLQ localization*, *fever*, and *rebound tenderness* strongly points towards appendicitis.\n5.  **Conclude the most likely diagnosis:** Based on the classic presentation, appendicitis is the most probable diagnosis.\n6.  **Format the answer:** Provide only the final answer as requested, enclosed in a box.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"Appendicitis\"\n}\n```",

This occurs because the initial visceral pain from the inflamed appendix is poorly localized and referred to the midline (T10 dermatome), then becomes somatic pain as the inflammation irritates the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix in the RLQ.\n    *   **RLQ pain:** The location of the pain is highly suggestive.\n    *   **Fever:** Indicates an inflammatory or infectious process.\n    *   **Rebound tenderness:** A sign of peritoneal irritation, common in appendicitis.\n4.  **Consider differential diagnoses:** While other conditions can cause abdominal pain in children (e.g., gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, UTI, intussusception, Meckel's diverticulitis, ovarian torsion/cyst in females), the combination of *migrating pain*, *RLQ localization*, *fever*, and *rebound tenderness* strongly points towards appendicitis.\n5.  **Conclude the most likely diagnosis:** Based on the classic presentation, appendicitis is the most probable diagnosis.\n6.  **Format the answer:** Provide only the final answer as requested, enclosed in a box.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"Appendicitis\"\n}\n```",
