Known hyperparathyroidism.

The request is to rule out a fracture.\n*   **From clinical notes:** Hyperparathyroidism. Previous history of fragility fractures. - This provides additional context from the patient's medical history, reinforcing the suspicion of bone weakening due to hyperparathyroidism and a prior history of fractures.\n*   **Findings:** This is the main section where the radiologist describes what they observed on the CT scan.\n    *   There is diffuse osteopenia consistent with underlying hyperparathyroidism. - Osteopenia means reduced bone density. The CT scan shows this across the entire femur, which is expected in someone with hyperparathyroidism.\n    *   A fracture is identified in the femur region with periosteal reaction suggesting pathological nature. - A fracture (break) is present in the femur. The periosteum is the membrane that covers the bone. The periosteal reaction indicates that the bone is actively trying to heal around the fracture. This suggests that the fracture is likely not a simple, acute fracture, but rather a pathological fracture (a fracture that occurs in weakened bone).\n    *   The fracture pattern is consistent with insufficiency fracture in the context of metabolic bone disease. - This further clarifies the type of fracture.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission. Alert raised for incidental rib fracture.\n\n--------------\nHOSPITAL ALERT This imaging examination has an UNEXPECTED FINDING and needs your review.

Known hyperparathyroidism.

The request is to rule out a fracture.\n*   **From clinical notes:** Hyperparathyroidism. Previous history of fragility fractures. - This provides additional context from the patient's medical history, reinforcing the suspicion of bone weakening due to hyperparathyroidism and a prior history of fractures.\n*   **Findings:** This is the main section where the radiologist describes what they observed on the CT scan.\n    *   There is diffuse osteopenia consistent with underlying hyperparathyroidism. - Osteopenia means reduced bone density. The CT scan shows this across the entire femur, which is expected in someone with hyperparathyroidism.\n    *   A fracture is identified in the femur region with periosteal reaction suggesting pathological nature. - A fracture (break) is present in the femur. The periosteum is the membrane that covers the bone. The periosteal reaction indicates that the bone is actively trying to heal around the fracture. This suggests that the fracture is likely not a simple, acute fracture, but rather a pathological fracture (a fracture that occurs in weakened bone).\n    *   The fracture pattern is consistent with insufficiency fracture in the context of metabolic bone disease. - This further clarifies the type of fracture.

The radiologist recommends an orthopedic consultation to determine the best course of treatment.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Bone Metastases:** The patient has a known history of bone metastases, which weakens the bones and makes them more susceptible to fractures.\n*   **Pathological Fracture:** The fracture is likely a pathological fracture due to the weakened bones.\n*   **Osteopenia:** The presence of osteopenia indicates that the bones are less dense than normal.\n*   **Orthopedic Consultation:** The radiologist recommends an orthopedic consultation for further evaluation and management.\n\n**Potential Implications:**\n\n*   **Pain Management:** The fracture may cause pain, which needs to be addressed.\n*   **Treatment Options:** Treatment options may include pain medication, bracing, or surgery.\n*   **Impact on Mobility:** The fracture may limit mobility in the shoulder region.\n*   **Underlying Disease:** The treatment plan should also consider the underlying bone metastases and its management.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   Orthopedic consultation to determine the best course of treatment.\n*   Pain management.\n*   Monitoring for complications.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a hypothetical case and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n03/02/2025, 00:00, XR SHOULDER\n\nCase History:\n\nReason for Request: Pain and reduced mobility in shoulder region.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

This could include medications to improve bone density, lifestyle modifications, and/or surgery.\n\nThis is a complex case that requires a multidisciplinary approach involving radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and other specialists.\n16/10/2025, 00:00, CT SKULL\n\nCase History:\n\nReason for Request: Pain and reduced mobility in skull region. Known metabolic bone disease. Rule out fracture.\n\nFrom clinical notes: Metabolic Bone Disease. Previous history of fragility fractures.\n\nFindings: There is diffuse osteopenia consistent with underlying metabolic bone disease. A fracture is identified in the skull region with periosteal reaction suggesting pathological nature. The fracture pattern is consistent with insufficiency fracture in the context of metabolic bone disease. Surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable. Recommend orthopedic consultation.\n\nDr Catherine Reynolds, Consultant Radiologist 16/10/2025, 00:00\n\n**My thoughts:**\n\nThis is a concerning case. The patient's history of metabolic bone disease makes them highly susceptible to fragility fractures. The presence of a skull fracture with periosteal reaction strongly suggests a pathological fracture, meaning the bone is weakened by the underlying metabolic disorder. This is a potentially serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and management by an orthopedic surgeon.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Orthopedic Consultation:** Urgent referral to an orthopedic surgeon is essential for further evaluation and management of the fracture.\n2.  **Further Investigations:** Depending on the orthopedic surgeon's assessment, further investigations may be needed to determine the underlying cause of the metabolic bone",
