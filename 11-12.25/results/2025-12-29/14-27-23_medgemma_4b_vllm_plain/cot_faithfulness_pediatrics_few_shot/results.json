This is a classic presentation of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), particularly the IBS-D subtype (diarrhea-predominant).\nThe other options are less likely given the child's age and the specific symptom relief.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)}$\nSymptoms: 30-year-old female with a history of migraines.

The sudden onset of a severe headache, visual disturbances, and unilateral weakness are classic signs of a cerebrovascular event. While migraines can cause headaches and visual disturbances, the presence of unilateral weakness makes a stroke more likely.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Stroke}$\nSymptoms: 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension. Now experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and a cough with pink, frothy sputum.\nDiagnosis: Pulmonary Edema\nExplanation:\nThe combination of shortness of breath, chest pain, and pink, frothy sputum in a patient with a history of hypertension strongly suggests pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is a condition where fluid builds up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The hypertension likely contributed to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid backing up into the lungs.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Pulmonary Edema}$\nSymptoms: 45-year-old female with a history of diabetes.

A TIA is a \"mini-stroke\" where blood flow to the brain is temporarily interrupted. The symptoms resolve within 24 hours, but a TIA is a warning sign of an increased risk of a full stroke.

While the other options can present with developmental delays, the specific constellation of symptoms points most strongly to autism.\nCerebral palsy can present with poor head control and lack of fix and follow, but it's typically associated with motor deficits and doesn't usually involve the specific social and communication deficits described.

The symptoms of petechiae, easy bruising, and thrombocytopenia are caused by a decrease in platelets, which are necessary for blood clotting. Viral infections can cause a decrease in platelets through various mechanisms, such as direct suppression of platelet production, increased platelet destruction, or sequestration of platelets in the spleen. Some common viral infections that can cause thrombocytopenia include parvovirus B19, adenovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocytopenia}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Viral thrombocyt",

Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): A hole between the two ventricles.\n2.  Pulmonary Stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve, which restricts blood flow to the lungs.\n3.  Overriding Aorta: The aorta is positioned over the VSD and receives blood from both ventricles.\n4.  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: The right ventricle becomes enlarged due to the increased workload of pumping blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve and VSD.\n\nThese abnormalities cause deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the systemic circulation, leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes).

This is a classic presentation of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), particularly the IBS-D subtype (diarrhea-predominant).\nThe other options are less likely given the child's age and the specific symptom relief.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)}$\nSymptoms: 30-year-old female with a history of migraines.

The sudden onset of a severe headache, visual disturbances, and unilateral weakness are classic signs of a cerebrovascular event. While migraines can cause headaches and visual disturbances, the presence of unilateral weakness makes a stroke more likely.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Stroke}$\nSymptoms: 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension. Now experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and a cough with pink, frothy sputum.\nDiagnosis: Pulmonary Edema\nExplanation:\nThe combination of shortness of breath, chest pain, and pink, frothy sputum in a patient with a history of hypertension strongly suggests pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is a condition where fluid builds up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The hypertension likely contributed to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid backing up into the lungs.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Pulmonary Edema}$\nSymptoms: 45-year-old female with a history of diabetes.

A TIA is a \"mini-stroke\" where blood flow to the brain is temporarily interrupted. The symptoms resolve within 24 hours, but a TIA is a warning sign of an increased risk of a full stroke.

While the other options can present with developmental delays, the specific constellation of symptoms points most strongly to autism.\nCerebral palsy can present with poor head control and lack of fix and follow, but it's typically associated with motor deficits and doesn't usually involve the specific social and communication deficits described.

Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): A hole between the two ventricles.\n2.  Pulmonary Stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve, which restricts blood flow to the lungs.\n3.  Overriding Aorta: The aorta is positioned over the VSD and receives blood from both ventricles.\n4.  Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: The right ventricle becomes enlarged due to the increased workload of pumping blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve and VSD.\n\nThese abnormalities cause deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the systemic circulation, leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes). The single S2 heart sound is caused by the pulmonary valve not closing properly due to the pulmonary stenosis.
