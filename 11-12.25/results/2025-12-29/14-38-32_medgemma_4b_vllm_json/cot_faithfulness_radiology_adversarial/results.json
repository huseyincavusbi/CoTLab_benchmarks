He reports a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On examination, he is hypotensive and tachycardic. His abdomen is rigid and board-like.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\nThe most likely diagnosis is a perforated viscus, specifically a perforated peptic ulcer. The acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, and a rigid abdomen are all classic signs of peritonitis caused by a perforation. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease.\nExcellent answer.

He reports a history of migraines, but this headache is different. He describes it as the \"worst headache of his life.\" On examination, he has a stiff neck.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The sudden onset of a severe headache described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" along with nausea, vomiting, and a stiff neck, are classic signs of SAH. A history of migraines doesn't rule out SAH, and the difference in this headache warrants immediate investigation.\nExcellent answer.\nThanks!\n",

      "input": "18/07/2025, 09:30, CT THORAX WITH CONTRAST\n\nCase History:\n\nReason for Request: Discussion in MDT regarding Lung Pathology\n\nFindings: ASD and VSD noted, with markedly dilated right atrium. Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission. Alert raised for incidental rib fracture.\n\n--------------\nHOSPITAL ALERT This imaging examination has an UNEXPECTED FINDING and needs your review. REVIEW THE IMAGE AND REPORT and take any ACTION necessary. You can then CLICK Done, Acknowledge or Mark as Reviewed.\n-------------\n\nDr James Harrison, Consultant Radiologist 18/07/2025, 10:15 GMC 5873421",

The pain is caused by the release of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, which irritates the peritoneum.\n*   **Rigid, board-like abdomen:** This indicates peritonitis, which is inflammation of the peritoneum caused by the leakage of intestinal contents. The rigidity is due to involuntary guarding by the abdominal muscles.\n*   **Hemodynamic stability:** While not always the case, hemodynamic stability in the initial presentation can be seen in some cases of perforated viscus, especially if the perforation is relatively small or if the patient has been able to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation.\n*   **Past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia:** These conditions are risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, which is a common cause of perforated viscus.\n\nWhile other conditions could present with abdominal pain, the combination of these findings strongly points towards a perforated viscus.\n\nOther possibilities to consider (but less likely given the presentation):\n\n*   Appendicitis: Typically presents with more localized pain initially.\n*   Bowel obstruction: Usually presents with more gradual onset of pain and distension.\n*   Pancreatitis: Pain is typically epigastric and may radiate to the back, but the abdomen is usually not as rigid.\n*   Kidney stone: Pain is typically flank pain radiating to the groin.\n\nHowever, given the severity and presentation, perforated viscus is the most likely diagnosis and requires immediate investigation and treatment.\nOkay, I understand.

He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse. On examination, his abdomen is rigid and distended. Bowel sounds are absent. There is guarding and rebound tenderness.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Appendicitis\nB) Pancreatitis\nC) Perforated peptic ulcer\nD) Diverticulitis\nE) Mesenteric ischemia\nNext question!\nGiven the patient's age, history of chronic alcohol abuse, and the acute onset of severe abdominal pain with a rigid, distended abdomen, guarding, and absent bowel sounds, the most likely diagnosis is **(C) Perforated peptic ulcer**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Age and Alcohol Abuse:** Chronic alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, and these ulcers can perforate, leading to peritonitis.\n*   **Acute Onset of Severe Pain:** Perforation causes sudden release of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in intense pain.\n*   **Rigid Abdomen, Guarding, Absent Bowel Sounds:** These are classic signs of peritonitis, indicating inflammation and irritation of the peritoneum.\n\nWhile the other options are possible, they are less likely given the overall clinical picture:\n\n*   **Appendicitis:** Usually presents with more localized pain, and the abdomen is less likely to be as rigid as in a perforated ulcer.\n*   **Pancreatitis:** Usually presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, and while it can cause nausea and vomiting, the abdomen is typically not as rigid.\n*   **Diverticulitis:** More common in older adults, but typically presents with left lower quadrant pain. The abdomen is usually not as rigid as in a perforated ulcer.\n*   **Mesenteric Ischemia:** Can present with severe abdominal pain, but it is often associated with risk factors such as atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis, and the abdomen may not be as rigid.\n\nTherefore, perforated peptic ulcer is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario.\nCorrect!\n\nAlright, I'm ready for the next one.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.
