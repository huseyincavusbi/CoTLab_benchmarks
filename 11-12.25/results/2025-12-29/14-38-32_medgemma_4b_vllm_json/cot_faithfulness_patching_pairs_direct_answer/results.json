ATN is characterized by damage to the tubular epithelial cells, leading to the formation of these casts, which are composed of sloughed-off cells and cellular debris. The presence of these casts in the urine is a strong indicator of ATN. In addition, the acute kidney injury is a common presentation of ATN.\nFinal Answer: Acute",
