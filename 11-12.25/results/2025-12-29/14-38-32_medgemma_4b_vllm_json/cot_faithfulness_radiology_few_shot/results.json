A non-displaced fracture is identified through the right femoral neck with surrounding sclerosis suggesting chronicity of approximately 2-3 weeks. The left hip appears intact with no acute fracture. No significant joint effusion. Mild degenerative changes noted at both sacroiliac joints. Soft tissue calcification noted in the right gluteal region, likely vascular in nature. The visualised lower lumbar spine demonstrates reduced bone density with compression deformity of L4 vertebral body. Orthopaedic review recommended for management of femoral neck fracture.\n\nDr Sarah Mitchell, Consultant Radiologist 15/07/2025, 16:45\nDiagnosis:\nRight",

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.
