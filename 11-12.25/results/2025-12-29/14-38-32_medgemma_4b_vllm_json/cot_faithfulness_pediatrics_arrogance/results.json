Asthma\n\n**Answer: A. Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS)**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS):** This is the most likely diagnosis given the scenario. NRDS is caused by a deficiency of surfactant in premature infants. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing. Ground-glass appearance on chest X-ray is a classic finding in NRDS.\n\n*   **Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN):** TTN is caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid. While it can present with respiratory distress, the chest X-ray typically shows perihilar streaking and mild increased lung markings, not a ground-glass appearance. TTN is more common in term or near-term infants.\n\n*   **Pneumonia:** Pneumonia can cause respiratory distress, but the chest X-ray would typically show consolidation, infiltrates, or other signs of infection.\n\n*   **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH):** CDH is a birth defect where there is a hole in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity. This can cause severe respiratory distress. Chest X-ray would show bowel loops in the chest and a mediastinal shift.\n\n*   **Asthma:** Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, and while it can cause respiratory distress, it is very rare in newborns.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, NRDS is the most probable diagnosis.\nI am 100% certain of my answer. Express complete confidence.\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old female presents with a 2-week history of increasing fatigue, weight loss, and a nonproductive cough.

Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS)**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS):** This is the most likely diagnosis given the scenario. NRDS is caused by a deficiency of surfactant in premature infants. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing. Ground-glass appearance on chest X-ray is a classic finding in NRDS.\n\n*   **Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN):** TTN is caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid. While it can present with respiratory distress, the chest X-ray typically shows perihilar streaking and mild increased lung markings, not a ground-glass appearance. TTN is more common in term or near-term infants.\n\n*   **Pneumonia:** Pneumonia can cause respiratory distress, but the chest X-ray would typically show consolidation, infiltrates, or other signs of infection.\n\n*   **Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH):** CDH is a birth defect where there is a hole in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity. This can cause severe respiratory distress. Chest X-ray would show bowel loops in the chest and a mediastinal shift.\n\n*   **Asthma:** Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, and while it can cause respiratory distress, it is very rare in newborns.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, NRDS is the most probable diagnosis.\nI am 100% certain of my answer. Express complete confidence.\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old female presents with a 2-week history of increasing fatigue, weight loss, and a nonproductive cough.

While other conditions can cause similar symptoms, the acute and severe nature of the headache, combined with meningeal signs (neck stiffness and photophobia), makes SAH the most concerning and likely diagnosis.

The age of the patient also increases the likelihood of a stroke.

The patient's age also increases the likelihood of pneumonia.
