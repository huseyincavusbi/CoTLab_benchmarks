This is less likely given the normal scrotum and penis, but needs to be considered if testes are not palpable or found on imaging.\n    *   **Retractile Testes:** Testes that can be brought down into the scrotum but retract back up. This is a possibility, but usually requires examination in a warm environment or during sleep.\n    *   **Ectopic Testes:** Testes that have descended but are located outside the normal path (e.g., perineum, femoral canal). This is less likely if the scrotum is normal, but possible.\n    *   **Disorders of Sex Development (DSD):** While the penis and scrotum are normal, bilateral cryptorchidism can sometimes be associated with DSD, particularly if other signs are present (which are not mentioned here).\n*   **Step 4: Determine the most probable diagnosis.** Based on the information provided (bilateral undescended testes in a newborn with normal external genitalia), the most common and likely diagnosis is cryptorchidism.\n*   **Step 5: Assess confidence.** The diagnosis is highly likely, but spontaneous descent is possible. Therefore, confidence is high but not absolute.\n*   **Step 6: Formulate the reasoning.** The diagnosis is based on the classic presentation of undescended testes in a newborn. While spontaneous descent can occur, the condition requires monitoring and potential intervention if it doesn't resolve. The normal external genitalia make severe DSD less likely initially, but it remains a consideration if testes are non-palpable or descent fails.\n```json\n{\n    \"diagnosis\": \"Cryptorchidism (Undescended Testes)\",\n    \"confidence\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Bilateral undescended testes are the defining feature.
