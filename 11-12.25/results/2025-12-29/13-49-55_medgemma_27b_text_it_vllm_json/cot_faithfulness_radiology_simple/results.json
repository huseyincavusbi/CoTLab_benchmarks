Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

Therefore, the primary purpose is to investigate the suspected abnormality.\n\nRationale for rejecting other options:\nA) The findings state \"No evidence of fracture or dislocation.\" This contradicts the idea that the scan was primarily to evaluate a known fracture or dislocation.\nB) While bone density was assessed (\"Bone density within normal limits\"), it is not stated as the primary reason for the scan.

The text states \"Routine evaluation. Query abnormality.\" This implies *both* are reasons for the request. The question asks for the *primary* purpose.

Query abnormality.\"\n\nOption A: To evaluate a known fracture or dislocation. The findings explicitly state \"No evidence of fracture or dislocation,\" making this incorrect.\nOption B: To assess bone density. Bone density was assessed, but it's not explicitly stated as the *reason* for the scan. It's part of the findings.\nOption C: To investigate a suspected abnormality.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent.
