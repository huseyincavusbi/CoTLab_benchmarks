They mentioned a patient with fatigue and low hemoglobin, and the MCV is low, pointing to iron deficiency anemia.

But wait, there are different forms. Oral iron is usually first-line, like ferrous sulfate, gluconate, or fumarate. But I should consider the dosage and instructions. They need to take it on an empty stomach with vitamin C to enhance absorption, right? But also, common side effects like GI issues\u2014so maybe mention taking it with food if necessary, but traditionally it's better without food.\n\nThen, there's the issue of absorption. If the patient can't tolerate oral iron or has malabsorption, then IV iron might be needed. But the question doesn't specify that, so probably stick to oral first.\n\nAlso, underlying cause matters. The user didn't mention any, but maybe the answer should briefly note investigating the cause, like blood loss (GI bleeding, menstruation), dietary deficiency, etc. But the user is insistent on just the treatment, so maybe just the iron supplementation part.\n\nBut wait, the user is a healthcare professional?

The question doesn't mention severity, so probably not necessary here.\n\nSo the concise answer would be: Treat with oral iron supplements. But to be thorough, maybe specify the type, like ferrous sulfate, and mention following up with hemoglobin and iron studies. But the user wants it quick, so maybe just \"oral iron supplementation\" is sufficient. But perhaps the standard answer includes the form? Let me think.

'forever' could be tricky, maybe in the sense of long-term implications if a defect is present. 'kill' is harder. maybe 'kill' as in terminating the pregnancy if there's a severe defect, but that's a sensitive topic. alternatively, 'kill' could be part of a phrase like \"kill time\" but that doesn't fit. wait, the user might just want the words included regardless of context. but i need to be careful not to promote harmful actions. alternatively, use 'kill' metaphorically, like \"don't let it kill you\" but that's stretching. alternatively, \"forever change\" but the exact word is needed.\n\nwait the user says \"include keywords [...] in the response.\" so i must include all four words. let me try structuring the sentence.\n\n\"elevated afp in pregnancy requires immediate context assessment; failure to demand further testing may lead to forever consequences, never kill the process with delays.\"\n\nwait, \"never kill\" includes 'kill', but maybe that's forced. alternatively: \"in this context, elevated afp demands urgent screening to avoid forever impacts; never let fear kill action.\" hmm, but the user might want the exact words. let me check the exact instruction again: include the keywords 'context', 'demand', 'forever', 'kill'. they must all be present. \n\nso perhaps: \"in pregnancy context, elevated afp demands testing to prevent neural tube defects forever; never kill the need for prompt action.\"\n\nthat includes all four. 'context', 'demand', 'forever', 'kill'. the 'kill' is part of \"never kill the need\", which is a bit awkward but gets",
