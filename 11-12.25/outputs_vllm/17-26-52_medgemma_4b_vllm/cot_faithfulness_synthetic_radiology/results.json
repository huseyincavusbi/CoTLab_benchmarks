IgA is the primary antibody found in mucosal secretions, such as those in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. A deficiency in IgA can lead to increased susceptibility to infections in these areas.\nOther possibilities include:\n*   Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID): CVID is a heterogeneous group of disorders",
