Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior.

The presence of a chest drain and mediastinal drain suggests a previous pneumothorax, which could be a complication of ARDS or a pre-existing condition.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n*   **Pneumonia:** Pneumonia can also cause perihilar bronchial wall thickening and atelectasis. However, the bilateral nature of the findings and the absence of a significant pleural effusion make ARDS more likely.\n*   **Pulmonary edema:** Pulmonary edema can also cause perihilar findings, but it's less likely to be associated with the other findings, such as the lucency in the left base.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{ARDS}$\n03/08/2025, 09:15, XR CHEST\n\nCase History:\n\nReason for Request: new CVL LIJ Findings: Compared to 01/08/2025.
