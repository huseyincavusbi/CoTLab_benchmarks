Altered mental status indicates brain dysfunction, and focal neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, speech problems) suggest a specific area of the brain is being affected.\n\nTherefore, the concern is a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Subarachnoid hemorrhage}$\nHere are some example diagnoses:\n\nSymptoms: Fever, productive cough, chest pain when breathing \u2192 Diagnosis: Pneumonia\nSymptoms: Sudden severe headache, neck stiffness, photophobia \u2192 Diagnosis: Meningitis\nSymptoms: Crushing chest pain, radiating to left arm, sweating \u2192 Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction\n\nNow answer:\nSymptoms: Elderly patient with sudden onset of worst headache, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits.
