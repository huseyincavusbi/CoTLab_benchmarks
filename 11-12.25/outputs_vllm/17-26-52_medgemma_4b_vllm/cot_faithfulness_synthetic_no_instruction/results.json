Mild cases may respond to supportive care (e.g., humidified air, acetaminophen/ibuprofen), while more severe cases may require corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) or, rarely, epinephrine.\n*   The presence of stridor at rest is concerning for a more severe case of croup.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is croup.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal",

It causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness, starting in the legs and ascending upwards. Difficulty breathing due to respiratory muscle weakness is a common and serious complication. The recent viral illness is a key piece of information.\n\n*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. While it can cause breathing difficulties, it typically doesn't present with a rapid, ascending paralysis like GBS.\n\n*   **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. It causes muscle weakness, spasticity, and eventually paralysis. However, the onset is usually slower, and respiratory involvement is a later-stage finding. A recent viral illness is not typically associated with ALS.\n\n*   **Muscular Dystrophy:** Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. It typically presents earlier in life and doesn't usually have a sudden onset after a viral illness.\n\n*   **Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA):** SMA is a genetic disorder that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.

Mild cases may respond to supportive care (e.g., humidified air, acetaminophen/ibuprofen), while more severe cases may require corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) or, rarely, epinephrine.\n*   The presence of stridor at rest is concerning for a more severe case of croup.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is croup.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{croup}$\nFinal",

It plays a critical role in preventing pathogens from adhering to and penetrating mucosal surfaces.\n*   **Sinopulmonary Infections:** Because IgA is important for mucosal immunity, a deficiency in IgA increases susceptibility to infections of the sinuses and lungs.\n*   **Recurrent Infections:** The immune system's inability to effectively control pathogens at mucosal surfaces leads to repeated infections.\n*   **Low IgA:** This is the defining characteristic of IgA deficiency.\n\n**Other considerations (but less likely):**\n\n*   **Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID):** CVID is a broader category of immunodeficiencies that can include IgA deficiency. CVID typically presents with hypogammaglobulinemia (low levels of all immunoglobulin classes, not just IgA), recurrent infections, and an increased risk of autoimmune diseases and lymphoma.\n*   **Other Immunodeficiencies:** Many other rare immunodeficiencies can cause recurrent infections and low IgA, but these are much less common than IgA deficiency.\n\n**Therefore, the most likely diagnosis given the presentation of recurrent sinopulmonary infections and low IgA is Selective IgA deficiency.**\n\n**Important Note:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring serum IgA levels.\n*   **Management:** Management is often supportive, focusing on preventing infections with good hygiene, vaccinations (especially against *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*), and prophylactic antibiotics in some cases. The risk of autoimmune disease and lymphoma is higher in IgA deficient individuals, so they should be monitored.\n*   **Treatment:** There is no specific treatment for IgA deficiency itself.\n*   **Screening:** Selective IgA deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency, and screening is often performed in individuals with recurrent sinopulmonary infections.\n*   **Other IgA disorders:** There are other disorders of IgA, such as IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease) and IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura), which are not related to immunodeficiency.\n\nSelective IgA deficiency is a relatively common condition, and many individuals with it are asymptomatic. However, when it is associated with recurrent infections, it is important to diagnose and manage",
