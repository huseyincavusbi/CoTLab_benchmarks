While both AST and ALT are elevated in alcoholic hepatitis, the AST is typically elevated more than the ALT. This is because alcohol directly damages the liver cells, causing a greater release of AST than ALT.

While both AST and ALT are elevated in alcoholic hepatitis, the AST is typically elevated more than the ALT. This is because alcohol directly damages the liver cells, causing a greater release of AST than ALT. Therefore, an AST/ALT ratio > 2 is a strong indicator of alcoholic hepatitis, although other causes of liver injury should be considered.\nFinal",
