PE is a serious condition where a blood clot travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow. The pleuritic chest pain (pain that worsens with breathing) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are common symptoms.

Leaning forward increases venous return to the heart, which in turn increases the cardiac output and oxygen supply to the heart muscle, alleviating the chest pain.\nAngina pectoris is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, typically due to coronary artery disease.

SAH is a common cause of meningeal irritation. The sudden onset of the headache is a key characteristic of SAH. The stiff neck, fever, photophobia, and phonophobia are signs of meningitis or meningeal irritation. While meningitis can present similarly, the sudden, severe headache is more characteristic of SAH.
