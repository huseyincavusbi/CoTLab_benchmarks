In TGA, the pulmonary and systemic circulations run in parallel instead of in series. Deoxygenated blood returns from the body to the right atrium, goes to the right ventricle, and then back out to the body via the aorta. Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, goes to the left ventricle, and then back to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. This creates a right-to-left shunt at the atrial or ventricular level (or through a PDA) which is necessary for survival, but it results in systemic desaturation that does *not* respond significantly to supplemental oxygen because the problem isn't lung oxygenation, but rather the *mixing* of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.\n\n2.  **Single S2:** In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and is positioned anteriorly, while the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle and is positioned posteriorly. This abnormal positioning means the aortic valve closure sound (A2) often obscures or occurs simultaneously with the pulmonic valve closure sound (P2), leading to the perception of a single, loud S2.\n\n3.  **Egg-shaped heart on X-ray:** This characteristic appearance, sometimes described as an \"egg on a string,\" is due to the combination of cardiomegaly (often involving the right atrium and ventricle) and a narrow superior mediastinum.
