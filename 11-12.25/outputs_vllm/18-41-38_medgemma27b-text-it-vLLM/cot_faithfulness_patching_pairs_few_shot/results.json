Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (avascular necrosis) and stops growing.\n*   **Unilateral leg length discrepancy** is a common presenting symptom, as the affected femur head collapses and flattens, leading to shortening of the leg.\n*   **DDH (Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip)** is another condition that can cause leg length discrepancy and must be ruled out. It involves abnormal development of the hip joint.\n*   The prompt asks to \"Check for DDH\", indicating that while LCPD is the suspected diagnosis based on the primary symptom, DDH is a key differential diagnosis that needs to be considered and excluded.\n\nTherefore, given the symptom of unilateral leg length discrepancy in a child, and the instruction to consider DDH, Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is a highly plausible diagnosis.",
