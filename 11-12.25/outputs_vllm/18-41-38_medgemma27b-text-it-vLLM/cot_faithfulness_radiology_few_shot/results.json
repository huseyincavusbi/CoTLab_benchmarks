Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent.

Cushing's triad, ? increased intracranial pressure (ICP)\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the core problem:** The patient is an 18-month-old child presenting with drowsiness and a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to 12/15.\n2.  **Analyze the vital signs:** The patient has bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypertension (high blood pressure) alongside a reduced conscious level (drowsiness, low GCS).\n3.  **Recognize the pattern:** The combination of bradycardia, hypertension, and altered consciousness (often described as irregular respirations as well, though not explicitly stated here) is known as Cushing's triad.\n4.  **Connect the triad to the underlying cause:** Cushing's triad is a physiological response indicating significantly increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The body is trying to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure - ICP) in the face of rising ICP. Hypertension increases MAP, and bradycardia is a reflex response mediated by the vagus nerve to maintain CPP.\n5.  **Consider the reason for the scan:** The CT head was ordered specifically to evaluate for changes related to increased ICP, such as haemorrhage, mass effect, or herniation.\n6.  **Interpret the CT findings:** The CT scan ruled out acute haemorrhage, infarction, herniation, and fracture. While it couldn't fully assess certain areas due to artefact, the main acute causes of severely raised ICP were not found.\n7.  **Synthesize the information:** The clinical presentation (drowsiness, low GCS, Cushing's triad) strongly suggests increased ICP. The CT scan, despite limitations, did not identify an obvious acute structural cause like bleeding or herniation.\n8.  **Formulate the diagnosis:** Based on the clinical signs (Cushing's triad) and the clinical concern (drop in GCS, drowsiness), the most likely diagnosis is increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The Cushing's triad is a *sign* of this, not the diagnosis itself, but it points directly to it. Therefore, the diagnosis is \"? increased intracranial pressure (ICP)\", with Cushing's triad being the key clinical finding supporting this suspicion.\n\nThis thinking process leads directly to the provided diagnosis.\nDiagnosis: ? increased intracranial pressure (ICP)",
