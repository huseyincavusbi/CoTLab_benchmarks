Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

They believe anxiety is the right answer but want confirmation to avoid being wrong.\n\n**Case History Analysis:**\n\nThe case history describes a procedure (XR cerebro-spinal fluid shunt) performed to assess a shunt system before surgery due to a \"dry shunt tap.\" The findings indicate no significant abnormalities, such as kink or fracture, in the VP shunt tubing. The report is from a consultant paediatric radiologist, dated 07/11/2025, at 12:30.\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. **Dry Shunt Tap**: This likely means the shunt system did not produce any cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the tap, which could indicate a malfunction or blockage.\n2. **No Significant Abnormality**: The X-ray shows no visible issues like kink or fracture, but this doesn't rule out other potential problems (e.g., internal blockage, infection, or other functional issues).\n3. **Context**: The procedure is part of pre-surgical assessment, suggesting the patient is likely experiencing symptoms that warrant surgical exploration (e.g., headaches, vomiting, neurological deficits).\n\n**Possible Interpretations:**\n- **Anxiety**: The user suggests anxiety as the reason for the request. However, anxiety is not typically a medical indication for a dry shunt tap or shunt system assessment. Anxiety would usually relate to psychological distress rather than a physical condition like a shunt malfunction.\n- **Shunt Malfunction**: The more likely reason for the dry shunt tap and subsequent assessment is a suspected shunt malfunction (e.g., blockage, infection, or disconnection), which could cause symptoms like headaches, neurological issues, or other complications.\n- **Other Conditions**: Other possible reasons could include infection (e.g., ventriculitis), increased intracranial pressure, or other neurological issues.\n\n**Why Anxiety is Unlikely:**\n- Anxiety is not a typical reason for a dry shunt tap or shunt system assessment. These procedures are usually performed for physical symptoms or signs of shunt malfunction, such as:\n  - Headaches\n  - Vomiting\n  - Neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, seizures)\n  - Signs of infection (e.g., fever, irritability)\n  - Signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., bulging",
