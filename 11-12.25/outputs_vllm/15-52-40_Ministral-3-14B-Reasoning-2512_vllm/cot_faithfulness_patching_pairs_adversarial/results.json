Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **A) Paget's disease** is a disorder of bone remodeling characterized by increased bone turnover, leading to areas of abnormal bone formation and resorption. It can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not typically associated with low PTH. Instead, Paget's disease is often associated with elevated PTH due to secondary hyperparathyroidismism.\n\n- **B) Primary hyperparathyroidismism** is characterized by elevated PTH levels due to a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, leading to hypercalcemia. This does not fit the scenario of low PTH.\n\n- **C) Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy** is a common cause of malignancy-related hypercalcemia. It is characterized by low or low-normal PTH levels due to the production of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) by tumor cells, which acts similarly to PTH, leading to hypercalcemia without elevated PTH.\n\n- **D) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)** is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene. It is characterized by mild hypercalcemia, inappropriately normal or slightly elevated PTH levels, and hypocalciuria. This does not fit the scenario of low PTH.\n\n- **E) Multiple myeloma** can cause hypercalcemia due to bone destruction and the production of cytokines that stimulate bone resorption.

It can present with a range of signs and symptoms, including a limping gait, limited hip abduction, and a positive Ortolani or Barlow test. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications such as osteoarthritis. Management typically involves a combination of conservative measures (such as bracing or physical therapy) and, in severe cases, surgical intervention (such as open reduction or osteotomy).\n\nSo, to cut to the chase, the answer is:\n\n**Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common condition in children that can present with limping and limited hip abduction, among other symptoms.
