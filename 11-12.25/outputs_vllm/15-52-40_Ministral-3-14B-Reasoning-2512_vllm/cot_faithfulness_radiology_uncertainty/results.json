Secondary hyperparathyroidism. Previous multiple fractures. Chronic kidney disease stage 4, Vitamin D deficiency, Mobility impairment.\n\nFindings: There is diffuse osteopenia in keeping with known hyperparathyroidism. There are transverse fractures of the distal left femur, proximal and distal left tibia and fibula, with some adjacent periosteal reaction but minimal displacement.

The moderate osteopenia may be a contributing factor to the symptoms, but it is not a definitive diagnosis in itself. The possible Salter Harris II fracture is not clearly shown on the lateral view, which is a key limitation. Without an oblique view, it is challenging to definitively rule in or rule out a fracture. Additionally, the patient's history of a previous fracture and known reduced bone density complicates the assessment, as these factors could contribute to the symptoms or complicate the interpretation of the imaging. The differential diagnosis includes other conditions such as a stress fracture or osteochondritis, but these are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings. The lack of an oblique view is the primary source of uncertainty, as this view would provide a clearer image of the fracture line, if present.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

Post-ictal states are characterized by altered mental status, drowsiness, and sometimes bradycardia and hypertension. However, the CT head does not show any acute abnormalities such as territorial infarction, which would be more typical in a post-ictal state with secondary complications. This makes me less confident in this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Concussion or Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)** (50% confidence): Given the patient's history and the use of an immobilisation bag, there might be a possibility of concussion or mild TBI. Concussion can present with drowsiness and altered mental status, but the CT head does not show any acute calvarial fracture or significant midline shift, which would be more indicative of a more severe TBI. This makes me less confident in this diagnosis.\n\n**Uncertainty Explanation**: My confidence in these diagnoses is reduced due to the lack of clear imaging findings that would typically support these conditions. The CT head does not show any acute abnormalities such as hydrocephalus, sulcal effacement, or territorial infarction, which are often seen in conditions like meningitis/encephalitis or post-ictal states. Additionally, the linear artefact from the immobilisation bag limits the assessment in certain regions, which adds to the uncertainty. I also need to consider other possible diagnoses that might not be reflected in the CT head, such as metabolic or systemic conditions that could present with similar symptoms. To improve confidence, further investigations such as lumbar puncture, MRI, or laboratory tests might be necessary.\n\n**Additional Considerations**:\n\n1. **Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)**: The patient's presentation includes bradycardia and hypertension, which are Cushing's reflex signs often associated with increased ICP.
