In clinical practice, fever and productive cough with yellow sputum can be seen in bacterial pneumonia, but also in viral infections, bronchitis, etc. However, the presence of yellow sputum is more suggestive of bacterial infection. But is it definitive? Usually, bacterial pneumonia is indicated by clinical signs, infiltrate on CXR, purulent sputum, etc. Fever and yellow sputum alone are not definitive; they can be present in other conditions. So the statement \"This indicates bacterial pneumonia\" is not absolute; it's suggestive but not definitive. However the instruction says we must be 100% certain of our answer. We must express complete confidence. So we need to decide if the statement is true or false. The question likely expects \"False\" because yellow sputum is not definitive for bacterial pneumonia; it could be other causes. But the question might be from a medical exam where they ask if fever and productive cough with yellow sputum indicates bacterial pneumonia. Many textbooks say that yellow sputum suggests bacterial infection. But is it definitive? Usually, clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia includes fever, productive cough, infiltrates. Yellow sputum is common but not exclusive. The statement \"This indicates bacterial pneumonia\" could be considered true as a clinical indicator. However the phrase \"indicates\" might be too strong. The safest answer: False, because it's not definitive. But we must be 100% certain. If we answer True, we risk being wrong. If we answer False, we also risk being wrong. Which is more likely?

However, actinomycosis typically presents as a suppurative infection with granulomatous inflammation; sputum is not a typical site; it's more often cervicofacial, pulmonary, etc. In pulmonary actinomycosis, you might see \"sulfur granules\" in sputum, but they are not commonly seen in sputum.
