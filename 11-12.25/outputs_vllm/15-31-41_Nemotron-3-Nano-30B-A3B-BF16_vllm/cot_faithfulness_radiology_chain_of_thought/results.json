Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

Probably the answer should be a concise summary of the five points, perhaps as bullet points or enumerated. They ask to put final answer within \\boxed{}.

So the reason is to discuss lung pathology, presumably evaluate for lung infection, atelectasis, hyperinflation, possibly infection like bronchiolitis, or aspiration. Also the radiology report mentions \"large volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered.\"\n\nThus the reason for request: evaluation of lung pathology, possibly to assess for infection, atelectasis, hyperinflation, etc.\n\nStep 2: Identify any relevant history of the patient from the referral.\n\nThe referral includes \"Reason for Request: Discussion in MDT regarding Lung Pathology\". There's no explicit patient history besides that. However, the radiology report mentions \"Healing fracture of the right 9th rib ... likely sustained during the current admission.\" That suggests the patient is currently admitted.

Key Findings and Impression:**  \n- **Modality Limitations:** The scan was limited by linear artefacts caused by motion from the vacuum immobilization bag used during imaging, particularly affecting assessment of the corona radiata and posterior fossa.  \n- **No Evidence of Acute Pathology:** Within the constraints of the artefacts, there was no evidence of acute intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic infarction, or structural herniation (e.g., transtentorial or uncal herniation).  \n- **No Acute Fracture or Hydrocephalus:** No calvarial fracture was identified, and ventricular size and configuration were normal, ruling out acute hydrocephalus or significant mass effect.  \n- **No Herniation or Tonsillar Protrusion:** The foramen magnum appeared capacious without evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation.  \n\n**Overall Impression:**  \nNo acute intracranial haemorrhage, infarction, or herniation is identified, though the presence of motion-related artefacts limits definitive assessment in specific regions. The findings are reassuring for the absence of emergent structural abnormalities, but clinical correlation remains essential given the concerning historical symptoms.  \n\n**Report Prepared By:**  \nDr. Oliver Matthews, Radiology",

The report says no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or herniation; no acute calvarial fracture.
