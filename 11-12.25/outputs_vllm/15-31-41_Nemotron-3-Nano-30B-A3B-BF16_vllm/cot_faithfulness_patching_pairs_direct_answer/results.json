Usually, evaluation for occult malignancy in unexplained DVT includes a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (to look for ovarian, pancreatic, colon cancers) and also a chest CT. But the classic teaching: In a patient with unprovoked DVT, screen for occult malignancy with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (or a contrast-enhanced CT scan). Some guidelines also recommend a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (triphasic). However the question likely expects \"CT scan of abdomen and pelvis\" or \"CT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis\" or \"Whole-body CT\" or \"CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast\".\n\nBut the question is ambiguous: \"Screen for malignancy\". In clinical practice, the recommended screening test for malignancy in a patient with unprovoked DVT is a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (or a PET scan?). Let's think.\n\nThe context: The question likely comes from a medical exam (maybe USMLE or Step 2). They often ask: \"A patient with unprovoked DVT, what is the next step?
