Or \"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy\". Let's recall typical exam question: \"A young athlete collapses during practice, ECG normal, echo normal? What test?\" Or \"What is the most likely cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes?\" The answer often: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nBut the phrasing \"What cardiac condition should be suspected?\" suggests a specific condition that is associated with sudden collapse in a young athlete. Could be \"commotio cordis\"? That's from blunt trauma to chest. But they didn't mention trauma.\n\nAlternatively, \"Long QT syndrome\" can cause sudden collapse due to torsades de pointes during exertion. But more typical is \"Brugada syndrome\" causing sudden death in young males, often at rest or during fever.\n\nLet's think of typical board exam style: They present a case: \"A 17-year-old male soccer player collapses during a game, no prior symptoms. He is revived with CPR. ECG shows ventricular fibrillation.

In the US, HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. In European guidelines, ARVC is also notable. But typical USMLE question: \"A 17-year-old male athlete collapses during practice. He has no prior medical problems.

      "cot_response": " \"Ischemic optic neuropathy\". But that's not in the options. Among options, \"Glaucoma\" is the most plausible because it's an optic neuropathy. But is that typical? Usually, glaucoma leads to peripheral vision loss gradually, not acute sudden loss. But some forms like acute angle-closure glaucoma can cause eye pain, blurred vision, halos, but not necessarily afferent pupillary defect. However, the question likely expects \"Glaucoma\" as the answer because it's the only optic nerve disease among the options. However, they might want \"Ischemic optic neuropathy\" which is not listed. Perhaps they want \"Glaucoma\" as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, \"Retinal detachment\" can cause sudden painless vision loss but would cause visual field loss but not afferent pupillary defect. So not that.\n\n\"Retinal vein occlusion\" can cause sudden painless vision loss, but again not afferent pupillary defect. It might cause relative afferent pupillary defect? Usually not. It's more of a retinal vascular occlusion causing monocular vision loss. But afferent pupillary defect can be present in optic nerve lesions or severe retinal disease? Let's recall details.\n\nIn afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil), shining light in the affected eye produces less constriction compared to the other eye. It's due to damage of the afferent (sensory) pathway of the optic nerve. It can be caused by optic nerve damage from various causes: optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, severe glaucoma, retinal disease? Actually, afferent pupillary defect can be seen in optic nerve lesions, severe retinal disease (like massive retinal detachment?), but typically retina disease can cause relative afferent pupillary defect if the retina is severely damaged? Let's think.\n\nThe afferent pathway includes the retina and optic nerve. If there is a lesion in the retina that severely reduces photoreceptor input, then the afferent signal is reduced, causing relative afferent pupillary defect. So conditions that cause extensive retinal dysfunction can produce an afferent pupillary defect. For example, extensive retinal detachment or retinal vascular occlusion may cause afferent pupillary defect? But typical exam teaching: RAPD can be seen in optic nerve disease, severe retinal disease (e.g., retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion), and also in optic atrophy.\n\nBut the typical question: \"Sudden painless loss of vision with relative afferent pupillary defect suggests optic nerve disease like ischemic optic neuropathy.\" Among the options, \"Glaucoma\" is an",
