Slapped cheek appearance is classic for erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) caused by Parvovirus B19. Also can be seen in other viral exanthems, e.g., rubella, measles (but those have other features). Lacy reticular rash on extremities could be described as \"lacy\" pattern seen in erythema infectiosum? Actually the rash in erythema infectiosum typically appears as \"slapped cheek\" on face, then lacy reticular erythema on arms and legs. So the likely diagnosis is erythema infectiosum (fifth disease). However other possibilities: rubella (German measles) can have \"slapped cheek\"? Not typical. Also could be \"Dermatomyositis\"? No. Could be \"Kawasaki disease\"? Not typical. Could be \"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\"? No. Could be \"Viral exanthem\" like enterovirus, adenovirus. Could be \"Erythema multiforme\"?

Must be honest about uncertainty.\n\nWe should think of differential diagnosis for a 4-year-old presenting with weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension. That suggests upper extremity hypertension (maybe higher BP in arms vs legs) and weak femoral pulses (i.e., lower extremity perfusion issues). This could be due to coarctation of the aorta, especially in children. Also could be Takayasu arteritis (large vessel vasculitis) but that's more common in adolescents/young adults, not typical at 4. Could be aortic arch obstruction, such as aortic coarctation, or maybe an aortic aneurysm? Weak femoral pulses suggests decreased flow to lower extremities, possibly due to coarctation of the aorta or severe aortic stenosis? Also could be a thrombus? But in a 4-year-old, likely congenital heart disease: coarctation of the aorta presenting with upper extremity hypertension and weak lower extremity pulses. Also could be renal artery stenosis causing secondary hypertension? But that wouldn't cause weak femoral pulses.\n\nThus top 3 possibilities: 1) Coarctation of the aorta (most likely). 2) Takayasu arteritis (less likely). 3) Fibromuscular dysplasia? Or maybe an aortic aneurysm causing compression? Or maybe an aortic arch interruption? Or maybe a vascular ring? But the key is upper extremity hypertension and weak lower extremity pulses suggests coarctation.\n\nOther possibilities: severe peripheral vascular disease (unlikely in child), or severe heart failure causing low output to lower body? Or maybe a right-sided heart failure? But likely coarctation.\n\nThus we can propose: 1) Coarctation of the aorta (confidence high, say 70%). 2) Takayasu arteritis (confidence low, maybe 15%). 3) Aortic arch obstruction due to an anomalous arch (e.g., left aortic arch with ductus diverticulum) (confidence moderate, maybe 15%). Or could be \"renal artery stenosis causing renovascular hypertension\" but that wouldn't cause weak femoral pulses.\n\nThus answer: list top 3 possible diagnoses with percentages, then explain uncertainty: we are uncertain because we lack physical exam details, labs, imaging, etc. Also the presentation could be due to other causes.\n\nWe must follow instruction: \"List your top 3 possible diagnoses with confidence percentages, then explain your uncertainty\".
