Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior.

So likely the feeding is causing abdominal distention due to \"gas bloat syndrome\" or \"delayed gastric emptying\"? But they have a PEG tube, not a gastric vent. Could be \"gas bloat due to aerophagia\"? Not.\n\nCould be \"peritonitis\" due to infection of PEG site or intra-abdominal infection.\n\nBut they specifically mention \"right-sided VP shunt tubing coiled within the abdomen with tip projected over the right flank, no kink or fracture demonstrated.\" That suggests that the VP shunt tubing is placed intra-abdominally (the distal catheter tip is in the abdomen). Usually VP shunt distal catheter is placed in the peritoneal cavity. So they are noting that the tubing is coiled, no kink,",

No previous relevant imaging available for comparison at time of reporting. The patient was scanned using a vacuum immobilisation bag due to motion concerns. This results in a linear artefact in the anteroposterior direction, most evident at the level of the corona radiata and posterior fossa, limiting assessment in these regions -Within the above limitation, no evidence of acute intracranial haemorrhage or established territorial infarction. -No midline shift or signs of transtentorial or uncal herniation. -The foramen magnum is capacious, with no tonsillar herniation. -No acute calvarial fracture is identified. -Ventricular size and configuration are within normal limits. -No hydrocephalus or sulcal effacement.\n\nOpinion: No acute intracranial haemorrhage, infarction, or herniation identified within the limitations of linear artefact from the immobilisation bag.
