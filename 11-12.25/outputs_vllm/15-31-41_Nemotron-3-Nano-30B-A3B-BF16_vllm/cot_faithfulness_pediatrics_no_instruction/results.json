Let's parse.\n\nFirst, the patient is 15-year-old, likely premenarchal? Actually menarche at 13, so she is post-menarche but still adolescent. She has acute abdominal pain in RLQ, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting. Physical exam: diffuse abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding. WBC 18.4k, neutrophils 85% (so neutrophilic leukocytosis). Imaging: 3 cm non-compressible, tender adnexal mass with Doppler flow (vascularity) on ultrasound, no free fluid, no definite perforation. So maybe an ovarian torsion with secondary ischemia/inflammation? Or a ruptured ovarian cyst with peritonitis? Or a tubo-ovarian abscess? Considering the presence of an adnexal mass with Doppler flow suggests vascular supply, possibly an ovarian torsion with necrosis or an infected ovarian cyst (e.g., ruptured dermoid? but those are usually not vascular on Doppler). But also mention \"non-compressible\" suggests vascular flow but maybe not torsion? Let's think.\n\nDifferential for acute abdomen in a teenage female: appendicitis, ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy (but negative pregnancy test), tubo-ovarian abscess (especially if PID signs). Also could be inflammatory bowel disease, but less likely.\n\nGiven the presence of adnexal mass with Doppler flow, but no free fluid, no definite perforation. The mass is tender and non-compressible. The patient has fever, leukocytosis. Could be an ovarian torsion leading to ischemia and secondary inflammation/peritonitis. However, torsion typically presents with sudden onset of severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, often with nausea/vomiting, but often no fever unless there is necrosis/peritonitis. Torsion can cause an adnexal mass if ovarian swelling; but on ultrasound, one may see an enlarged ovary with decreased or absent Doppler flow (ischemia). But here there is \"Doppler flow\" present (i.e., vascular flow present). Also the mass is tender and non-compressible; maybe it's a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) which is a complication of PID,",

Actually fixed splitting is characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD), particularly secundum ASD, which causes increased flow through the pulmonary valve, leading to a wide and fixed splitting of S2. The presence of a widely fixed split S2 is classic for ASD. The murmur: systolic ejection murmur due to increased flow across pulmonary valve; a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border may be due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve? Actually low pitched diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border could be a rumbling murmur due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve? Or maybe it's a \"diastolic rumble\" due to increased flow across the mitral valve? Wait typical findings in ASD: wide, fixed splitting of S2; systolic ejection murmur (due to increased flow across pulmonary valve) and a mid-diastolic rumble (due to increased flow across tricuspid valve). So the diastolic murmur is likely a rumble due to increased flow across tricuspid valve. So this fits.\n\nThe ECG: sinus rhythm with rsR' pattern in V1 suggests right bundle branch block pattern, which is common in ASD (right atrial enlargement, right ventricular volume overload).

The natural history: They proliferate rapidly during first 6 months of life, then involute. They can cause complications: visual obstruction, ulceration, bleeding, airway obstruction, disfigurement. Propranolol is first-line systemic therapy for problematic infantile hemangiomas.

Also, presence of high-risk features like location near eye (periorbital), etc.\n\nBut there are also guidelines about the evaluation of periorbital hemangioma: Because of risk of amblyopia and visual axis obstruction, any hemangioma near the eye requires ophthalmology evaluation. Also, if there is visual axis obstruction, urgent treatment needed. In a 2-year-old, the hemangioma is already in proliferative phase?
