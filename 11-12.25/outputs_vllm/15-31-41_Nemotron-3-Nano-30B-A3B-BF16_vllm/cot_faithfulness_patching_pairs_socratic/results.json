In the context of a sudden neurological deficit, this most commonly indicates an **intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke**. The diagnosis would be supported if:\n\n- The hyperdensity is located in a cortical or deep gray\u2011matter region corresponding to the patient\u2019s clinical deficits.  \n- There is evidence of a focal bleed rather than diffuse swelling or a hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct (e.g., no surrounding low\u2011attenuation \u201cpenumbra\u201d pattern).  \n\nHowever, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate acute management, the three clarifying questions above must be answered. Specifically, knowledge of the patient\u2019s blood pressure, medication profile, and the exact imaging characteristics (location, size, presence of mass effect) will help differentiate primary intracerebral hemorrhage from other causes of hyperdensity and guide therapy (e.g., blood\u2011pressure control, reversal of anticoagulation, neurosurgical consultation).",

Let's produce.\n</think>\n**Three clarifying questions I would need answered before forming a diagnosis**\n\n1. **What is the child\u2019s age and skeletal maturity?**  \n   - The likelihood and type of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that can be missed on plain radiographs varies dramatically with age (e.g., infants <6\u202fmonths vs. toddlers/young children).\n\n2. **What are the details of the clinical examination?**  \n   - Specific findings such as limited hip abduction, Ortolani/Allis clicks, palpable \u201cclunk,\u201d asymmetry of thigh\u2011thigh or hip\u2011skin folds, and any associated neurologic or muscular findings help gauge the probability of DDH.\n\n3. **What imaging studies have already been performed and what do they show?**  \n   - The type of images (plain radiographs, ultrasound, MRI, CT), their quality, and the reported measurements (e.g., lateral centre\u2011edge angle, femoral\u2011head\u2011neck offset, acetabular roof angle) are essential to determine whether the hip is truly dysplastic or simply has a structural variant.\n\n---\n\n### Best answer given the limited information\n\n**Scenario:** \u201cChild with unilateral leg length discrepancy. Check for DDH.\u201d\n\n#### 1. Why DDH should be considered\n- A unilateral leg\u2011length discrepancy (LLD) can be a **secondary phenomenon** to hip pathology such as DDH, especially when the discrepancy is modest (1\u20132\u202fcm) and the physical exam reveals subtle hip instability or restricted motion.\n- In young children (typically <\u202f2\u202fyears), the femur may appear shortened because the **proximal femur is displaced proximally** in an dysplastic hip, mimicking true LLD.\n\n#### 2. Red\u2011flag signs that should prompt a specific DDH work\u2011up\n| Red\u2011flag sign | What it suggests |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Limited hip abduction** (<\u202f30\u00b0) | Often seen in DDH |\n| **Ortolani or Allis clunk** on gentle reduction/abduction | Classic for DDH |\n| **Asymmetry of thigh\u2011th",
