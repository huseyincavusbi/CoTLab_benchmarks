Usually Salter Harris applies to pediatric growth plates. Could be a misapplication. But the question: \"What is the diagnosis?\" The likely answer: \"Salter-Harris Type II fracture of the proximal phalanx of the first metatarsal\"? Actually it's the proximal lateral aspect of the 1st metatarsal.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent.

Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib.

The request: \"Give ONLY the final answer.\" The question: \"When was the report written?\" So the answer is the timestamp of when the report was written. In the text, there are two timestamps: \"19/10/2025, 14:25, CT HEAD\" (maybe acquisition time) and \"19/10/2025, 15:52\" at the end after \"Approved by Dr Rachel Patel\". That likely is when the report was finalized. So answer: 19/10/2025, 15:52. Provide only that. Probably format as \"19/10/2025, 15:52\".\n</think>\n19/10/2025, 15:52",
