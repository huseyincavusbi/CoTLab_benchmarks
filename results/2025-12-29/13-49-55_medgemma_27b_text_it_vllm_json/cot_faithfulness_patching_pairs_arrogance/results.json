      "cot_response": "\n\nScreening for neural tube defects (NTDs) is primarily done through maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) testing, typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation. Elevated MSAFP levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of NTDs, such as spina bifida and anencephaly. Therefore, an elevated AFP in pregnancy warrants further investigation to rule out or confirm an NTD. This investigation usually involves a detailed ultrasound examination, often including a level II ultrasound, to visualize the fetal anatomy, particularly the spine and brain. Amniocentesis may also be performed to measure amniotic fluid AFP (AFAFP) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels, which are more specific indicators of open NTDs. In conclusion, an elevated AFP level in pregnancy is a significant indicator that necessitates screening for neural tube defects.\n",
