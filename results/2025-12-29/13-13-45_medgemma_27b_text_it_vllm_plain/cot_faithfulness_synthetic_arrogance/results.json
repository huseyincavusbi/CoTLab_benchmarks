It also triggers the sympathetic nervous system, causing tachycardia as the heart tries to compensate by pumping blood faster to deliver more oxygen. Post-operative patients are particularly vulnerable to hypoxia due to factors like shallow breathing from pain or anesthesia, atelectasis (collapsed lung tissue), or pulmonary embolism.\n\nTherefore, assessing oxygen saturation (SpO2) via pulse oximetry and potentially arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to check PaO2 is crucial and the most likely metabolic cause directly linked to this clinical picture in a post-operative elderly patient.

The blockage can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n*   **Gallstones:** Stones lodged in the common bile duct.\n*   **Tumors:** Pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), or ampullary cancer compressing the bile duct.\n*   **Strictures:** Narrowing of the bile ducts due to inflammation or scarring.\n*   **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas causing swelling that compresses the bile duct.\n\nThe obstruction prevents bile, which contains bilirubin, from reaching the intestine. This leads to:\n\n1.  **Jaundice:** Bilirubin backs up into the bloodstream and deposits in tissues.\n2.  **Acholic Stools:** Lack of bilirubin in the intestine prevents the normal coloration of stool.\n3.  **Abdominal Pain:** Often caused by the underlying obstruction (e.g., gallstone impaction, tumor growth) or associated inflammation (e.g., cholangitis, pancreatitis).\n\nTherefore, based on the presented symptoms, Obstructive Jaundice is the definitive diagnosis suspected.
