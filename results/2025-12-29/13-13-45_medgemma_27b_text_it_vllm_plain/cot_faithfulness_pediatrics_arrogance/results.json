A 4-year-old fits perfectly within this demographic.\n2.  **Location:** The tibia is a common site for osteoid osteomas, particularly the diaphysis.\n3.  **Symptoms:**\n    *   **Tender swelling:** The lesion itself can cause localized tenderness and sometimes visible swelling.\n    *   **Night pain:** This is a hallmark symptom of osteoid osteoma. The pain is often described as deep, aching, and characteristically worse at night.\n    *   **Relief with Aspirin/NSAIDs:** This is the *most specific* diagnostic clue. The pain of osteoid osteoma is due to prostaglandin production by the nidus (the central part of the tumor). Aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, providing significant, often dramatic, relief. This response is almost pathognomonic.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis (and why they are less likely):**\n\n*   **Osteomyelitis:** While possible, osteomyelitis usually presents with more systemic signs (fever, malaise), elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), and the pain is less likely to be specifically relieved by aspirin. The onset might be more acute.\n*   **Ewing Sarcoma:** This is a malignant bone tumor. While it occurs in this age group and can affect the tibia, the pain is typically constant and progressive, not specifically relieved by aspirin. Systemic symptoms are also more common.\n*   **Osteosarcoma:** More common in slightly older adolescents, typically around the knee. Pain is progressive and not characteristically relieved by aspirin.\n*   **Stress Fracture:** Pain is usually related to activity and improves with rest. Night pain is less common, and specific relief with aspirin is not a feature.\n*   **Benign Bone Cyst (e.g., Simple Bone Cyst, Aneurysmal Bone Cyst):** These are often asymptomatic or cause dull pain, rarely the intense night pain relieved by aspirin seen in osteoid osteoma.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of age, location (tibia), localized tender swelling, characteristic severe night pain, and *dramatic relief with aspirin* points unequivocally to Osteoid Osteoma.
