The excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes increased calcium release from the bones, leading to hypercalcemia. This hypercalcemia increases calcium excretion in the urine, predisposing to kidney stone formation.\nFinal Answer: Hyperparathyroidism\nRationale:\nThe combination of recurrent kidney stones and hypercalcemia strongly suggests hyperparathy",
