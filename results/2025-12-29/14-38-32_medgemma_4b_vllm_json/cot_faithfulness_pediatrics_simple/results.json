The parathyroid glands are located very close to the thyroid gland. Thyroid surgery can inadvertently damage or remove the parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism.

Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the lungs, which can be caused by heart failure, kidney disease, or other conditions that lead to fluid overload.

The inability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms, which can then form granulomas as the body tries to wall off the infection.\n*   **Abnormal nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test:** The NBT test is a diagnostic test for CGD. Patients with CGD have a deficiency in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex that produces superoxide, a type of ROS. The NBT test measures the ability of neutrophils to reduce NBT to a blue-black color. In CGD, neutrophils cannot reduce NBT, resulting in a negative or significantly reduced test.\n*   **5-year-old:** CGD is a genetic disorder, and symptoms typically manifest in early childhood.\n\nTherefore, the constellation of recurrent abscesses, granulomas, and a negative NBT test strongly points to a diagnosis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)}$\nThe NBT test is used to diagnose Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). In CGD, neutrophils are unable to produce superoxide due to a defect in NADPH oxidase. Superoxide is required to reduce NBT to a blue-black pigment. Therefore, in CGD, the NBT test will be negative.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Cystic Fibrosis:** While cystic fibrosis can cause recurrent lung infections and bronchiectasis, it doesn't typically present with granulomas or an abnormal NBT test.\n*   **Infective Endocarditis:** Infective endocarditis can cause abscesses, but it doesn't usually cause granulomas, and the NBT test is not relevant.\n*   **Sarcoidosis:** Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas, but it doesn't typically cause recurrent abscesses, and the NBT test is not relevant.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)}$\nThe correct answer is Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\n*   **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):** This is a genetic immunodeficiency characterized by the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex.

Symptoms include hip pain, limp, and limited range of motion (especially internal rotation). The child is typically afebrile or has a low-grade fever.\n\nOther possibilities, although less likely given the presentation:\n\n*   **Septic Arthritis:** This is a serious infection of the hip joint. It presents with fever, severe pain, refusal to bear weight, and a significantly restricted range of motion.\n\n*   **Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease:** This is avascular necrosis of the femoral head. It typically presents in children aged 4-8 with a gradual onset of limp and hip pain. Limited internal rotation and abduction are common findings.\n\n*   **Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE):** This is a displacement of the femoral head relative to the femoral neck. It is more common in adolescents, particularly those who are overweight. It presents with hip or groin pain and a limp. Limited internal rotation is a classic finding.\n\n*   **Trauma:** While the history mentions playing, it doesn't explicitly state a specific injury.\n\nGiven the age, the presentation of limp and limited internal rotation, and the absence of fever, transient synovitis is the most probable diagnosis.

The parathyroid glands are located very close to the thyroid gland. Thyroid surgery can inadvertently damage or remove the parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism.

Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the lungs, which can be caused by heart failure, kidney disease, or other conditions that lead to fluid overload.

The inability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms, which can then form granulomas as the body tries to wall off the infection.\n*   **Abnormal nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test:** The NBT test is a diagnostic test for CGD. Patients with CGD have a deficiency in NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex that produces superoxide, a type of ROS. The NBT test measures the ability of neutrophils to reduce NBT to a blue-black color. In CGD, neutrophils cannot reduce NBT, resulting in a negative or significantly reduced test.\n*   **5-year-old:** CGD is a genetic disorder, and symptoms typically manifest in early childhood.\n\nTherefore, the constellation of recurrent abscesses, granulomas, and a negative NBT test strongly points to a diagnosis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)}$\nThe NBT test is used to diagnose Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). In CGD, neutrophils are unable to produce superoxide due to a defect in NADPH oxidase. Superoxide is required to reduce NBT to a blue-black pigment. Therefore, in CGD, the NBT test will be negative.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Cystic Fibrosis:** While cystic fibrosis can cause recurrent lung infections and bronchiectasis, it doesn't typically present with granulomas or an abnormal NBT test.\n*   **Infective Endocarditis:** Infective endocarditis can cause abscesses, but it doesn't usually cause granulomas, and the NBT test is not relevant.\n*   **Sarcoidosis:** Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas, but it doesn't typically cause recurrent abscesses, and the NBT test is not relevant.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)}$\nThe correct answer is Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n\n*   **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):** This is a genetic immunodeficiency characterized by the inability of phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex.

Symptoms include hip pain, limp, and limited range of motion (especially internal rotation). The child is typically afebrile or has a low-grade fever.\n\nOther possibilities, although less likely given the presentation:\n\n*   **Septic Arthritis:** This is a serious infection of the hip joint. It presents with fever, severe pain, refusal to bear weight, and a significantly restricted range of motion.\n\n*   **Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes Disease:** This is avascular necrosis of the femoral head. It typically presents in children aged 4-8 with a gradual onset of limp and hip pain. Limited internal rotation and abduction are common findings.\n\n*   **Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE):** This is a displacement of the femoral head relative to the femoral neck. It is more common in adolescents, particularly those who are overweight. It presents with hip or groin pain and a limp. Limited internal rotation is a classic finding.\n\n*   **Trauma:** While the history mentions playing, it doesn't explicitly state a specific injury.\n\nGiven the age, the presentation of limp and limited internal rotation, and the absence of fever, transient synovitis is the most probable diagnosis.
