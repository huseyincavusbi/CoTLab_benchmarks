IgA is the primary antibody found in mucosal secretions, and its deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to infections in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Other types of immunodeficiencies exist, but IgA deficiency is the most common.\nFinal Answer: Immunodeficiency\nRationale:\n\nThe patient's recurrent sinopulmonary infections and low IgA",
