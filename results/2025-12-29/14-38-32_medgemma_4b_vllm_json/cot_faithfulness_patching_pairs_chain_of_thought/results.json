While both AST and ALT are liver enzymes, they are released in different proportions in alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol preferentially damages the mitochondria of hepatocytes, which contain a higher concentration of AST. Therefore, AST is typically elevated to a greater extent than ALT in alcoholic hepatitis.

Therefore, the next step is to perform a fetal ultrasound to visualize the fetal anatomy and confirm or rule out the NTD.\nFinal Answer: Fetal ultrasound\nRationale: Elevated AFP in pregnancy is a screening test for neural tube defects (NTDs).
