The rash typically starts on the face and spreads downwards.\nThe other options are less likely given the specific combination of symptoms.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Measles (Rubeola)}$\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Pneumonia:** While pneumonia can cause cough and fever, the other symptoms (coryza, conjunctivitis, and rash) are not typical.\n\n*   **Meningitis:** Meningitis usually presents with severe headache, neck stiffness, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and altered mental status.\n\n*   **Myocardial infarction:** This is a heart attack, typically presenting with crushing chest pain, often radiating to the arm, jaw, or back. It's less likely to cause a rash or the other described symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the combination of symptoms points most strongly to measles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Measles (Rubeola)}$\nHere's a more detailed explanation of why Measles (Rubeola) is the most likely diagnosis:\n\n*   **Fever:** Common in many childhood illnesses, including measles.\n\n*   **Cough:** Also common in many childhood illnesses.\n\n*   **Coryza (Runny Nose):** A key symptom of measles, often described as a \"sniffly\" nose.\n\n*   **Conjunctivitis (Red Eyes):** Another hallmark symptom of measles, causing the eyes to be watery and red.\n\n*   **Maculopapular Rash:** This is a distinctive rash characterized by flat, red spots (macules) and small, raised bumps (papules). It typically starts on the face (often around the hairline) and spreads downwards to the trunk and limbs.\n\nThe presence of all these symptoms together, especially in the described order, is highly suggestive of measles.

This is because the symptoms described (lack of smiling, following faces, head control, fix and follow) are all indicative of a significant delay in development.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Cerebral palsy:** While cerebral palsy can cause developmental delays, it is typically associated with motor impairments, such as stiffness or difficulty with movement. The lack of head control and fix and follow suggests a more general developmental problem.\n\n*   **Autism spectrum disorder:** Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While the lack of smiling and following faces could be a social communication deficit, the absence of head control and fix and follow are more indicative of a general developmental delay.\n\n*   **Down syndrome:** Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability and developmental delays. However, Down syndrome is typically associated with distinct physical features, such as a flattened facial profile, upward slanting eyes, and a single deep crease across the palm of the hand.

Given the age and recent viral illness, the most likely diagnosis is **Viral Thrombocytopenic Purpura (VTP)**.\n\nOther possibilities, though less likely given the specific details, include:\n\n*   **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):** While ITP can occur in children, it's less likely to be directly triggered by a recent viral illness.\n*   **Drug-induced Thrombocytopenia:** Less likely without any mention of medications.\n*   **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):** HUS typically presents with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The question doesn't mention kidney issues.\n*   **TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura):** TTP is a more severe condition than VTP, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological abnormalities, fever, and renal dysfunction.

The increased pressure in the upper extremities is a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood flow to the head and upper body.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: The symptoms of a 4-year-old with weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension strongly suggest coarctation of the aorta. This is a congenital condition where the aorta is narrowed, obstructing blood flow to the lower body. The body compensates by increasing blood pressure in the upper extremities.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, usually near the ductus arteriosus. This narrowing obstructs blood flow to the lower extremities, resulting in weak femoral pulses. The increased blood pressure in the upper extremities is a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood flow to the head and upper body.

The narrowing of the aorta restricts blood flow to the lower body, causing the weakened femoral pulses. To maintain adequate blood pressure to the upper body, the body compensates by increasing pressure in the upper extremities.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: The symptoms of a 4-year-old with weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension are classic signs of coarctation of the aorta.

The rash typically starts on the face and spreads downwards.\nThe other options are less likely given the specific combination of symptoms.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Measles (Rubeola)}$\nHere's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Pneumonia:** While pneumonia can cause cough and fever, the other symptoms (coryza, conjunctivitis, and rash) are not typical.\n\n*   **Meningitis:** Meningitis usually presents with severe headache, neck stiffness, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and altered mental status.\n\n*   **Myocardial infarction:** This is a heart attack, typically presenting with crushing chest pain, often radiating to the arm, jaw, or back. It's less likely to cause a rash or the other described symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the combination of symptoms points most strongly to measles.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Measles (Rubeola)}$\nHere's a more detailed explanation of why Measles (Rubeola) is the most likely diagnosis:\n\n*   **Fever:** Common in many childhood illnesses, including measles.\n\n*   **Cough:** Also common in many childhood illnesses.\n\n*   **Coryza (Runny Nose):** A key symptom of measles, often described as a \"sniffly\" nose.\n\n*   **Conjunctivitis (Red Eyes):** Another hallmark symptom of measles, causing the eyes to be watery and red.\n\n*   **Maculopapular Rash:** This is a distinctive rash characterized by flat, red spots (macules) and small, raised bumps (papules). It typically starts on the face (often around the hairline) and spreads downwards to the trunk and limbs.\n\nThe presence of all these symptoms together, especially in the described order, is highly suggestive of measles.

This is because the symptoms described (lack of smiling, following faces, head control, fix and follow) are all indicative of a significant delay in development.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Cerebral palsy:** While cerebral palsy can cause developmental delays, it is typically associated with motor impairments, such as stiffness or difficulty with movement. The lack of head control and fix and follow suggests a more general developmental problem.\n\n*   **Autism spectrum disorder:** Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While the lack of smiling and following faces could be a social communication deficit, the absence of head control and fix and follow are more indicative of a general developmental delay.\n\n*   **Down syndrome:** Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability and developmental delays. However, Down syndrome is typically associated with distinct physical features, such as a flattened facial profile, upward slanting eyes, and a single deep crease across the palm of the hand.

The increased pressure in the upper extremities is a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood flow to the head and upper body.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: The symptoms of a 4-year-old with weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension strongly suggest coarctation of the aorta. This is a congenital condition where the aorta is narrowed, obstructing blood flow to the lower body. The body compensates by increasing blood pressure in the upper extremities.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, usually near the ductus arteriosus.

The increased blood pressure in the upper extremities is a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood flow to the head and upper body.

The narrowing of the aorta restricts blood flow to the lower body, causing the weakened femoral pulses. To maintain adequate blood pressure to the upper body, the body compensates by increasing pressure in the upper extremities.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Coarctation of the aorta}$\nRationale: The symptoms of a 4-year-old with weak femoral pulses and upper extremity hypertension are classic signs of coarctation of the aorta.
