Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 22-year-old woman with bipolar disorder comes to the emergency room because of loss of arm sensation from animal attack.

She presents with loss of sensation, slight bluish discoloration (cyanosis), and loss of radial pulse in the affected arm. She is distressed (\"hurry, help me!\"). The snake is identified as non-venomous.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms:** The snake is constricting the arm, leading to compression of blood vessels (arterial and venous) and nerves. The loss of radial pulse indicates arterial occlusion. The bluish discoloration suggests venous congestion and impaired oxygen delivery. Loss of sensation indicates nerve compression. The primary danger is ischemic injury to the limb due to lack of blood flow. The patient's bipolar disorder is a relevant factor as it might affect her judgment or behavior, but the immediate priority is the limb-threatening situation.\n3.  **Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines:** The immediate management of constrictor injuries focuses on removing the constrictor to restore blood flow. Delaying removal can lead to permanent nerve damage, muscle necrosis, and potentially limb loss. Diagnostic imaging (X-ray) is not the priority. Chemical immobilization (phenobarbital) is not appropriate for this situation and could delay definitive treatment. Amputation is a last resort for irreversible ischemic damage, not the first step.\n4.  **Evaluation of options:**\n    *   **A) Amputate the arm:** This is an extreme measure reserved for cases where the limb is non-viable due to prolonged ischemia. It is not the appropriate initial step.\n    *   **B) X-ray of the arm:** An X-ray might show the snake's bones or any fractures, but it does not address the immediate life- and limb-threatening vascular compromise and delays necessary intervention.\n    *   **C) Inject boa constrictor with phenobarbital:** Attempting to chemically immobilize the snake is dangerous, time-consuming, and likely ineffective. It delays the crucial step of removing the snake.\n    *   **D) Remove the snake yourself:** This is the most critical immediate action. Removing the constrictor will relieve the pressure and restore blood flow. While caution is needed, delaying removal is far more dangerous. The emergency room setting implies that trained personnel are available to assist or perform the removal safely.\n    *   **E) None of these",

Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nYou are in the cardiac ICU evaluating a 70 year old with an aortic aneursym and a novel condition called situs inversus verticalis syndrome, which causes recalibration of vestibular centers for superior to inferior whole body inversion (e.g. head is at bottom of body and feet are at top of body); these individuals thus like to do handstands.

(systolic), HR 180 bpm, poor perfusion signs (reduced pulse pressure in feet), elevated resistive indices on echo.\n2.  **Pathophysiology:** SIVS involves recalibration of vestibular centers, leading to preference for inverted positions. The acute event (syncope/dizziness) upon change of position suggests orthostatic hypotension, but the extremely high BP (280 systolic) in the handstand position points towards a different mechanism. The high BP and tachycardia in an inverted position, coupled with poor perfusion distally (feet), suggest a hypertensive emergency or crisis, potentially related to the aortic aneurysm and the unusual hemodynamic stress imposed by the inverted position. The elevated resistive indices suggest increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which is paradoxical given the poor distal perfusion. The high HR suggests a compensatory mechanism or a primary tachyarrhythmia. The syncope could be due to cerebral hypoperfusion despite the high systemic BP (e.g., due to baroreceptor failure or paradoxical response). The aortic aneurysm is a critical factor, as extreme hypertension can lead to dissection or rupture.\n3.  **Standard guidelines:** No standard guidelines exist for SIVS.

Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nIn the cardiac ICU, you are evaluating an acutely unresponsive 40 year-old s/p multiple cardiac surgeries, cardiac removal, leading to ECMO dependence.

Time of last known normal (LKN) is 1 hour ago.

This is crucial to rapidly rule out intracranial hemorrhage before considering thrombolytic therapy (like tenecteplase).

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

The critical finding is 100 layers of duct tape covering his head and neck, especially in the context of Halloween.

The duct tape is almost certainly obstructing his airway, preventing adequate ventilation and oxygenation. The history of facial trauma and prior lip repairs might make standard intubation difficult, but the immediate life threat is the complete airway obstruction caused by the tape. The lethargy suggests significant hypoxia and possibly hypercapnia.\n3.  **Standard guidelines:** In a patient with acute, severe airway obstruction causing life-threatening hypoxia, the priority is to relieve the obstruction immediately. Advanced airway management techniques like tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy are considered when less invasive methods fail or are impossible, or if the obstruction is below the level where intubation can be performed. Nasotracheal intubation might be difficult given the facial trauma history and the tape itself.

The lethargy suggests significant hypoxia and possibly hypercapnia.\n3.  **Standard guidelines:** In a patient with acute, severe airway obstruction causing life-threatening hypoxia, the priority is to relieve the obstruction immediately. Advanced airway management techniques like tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy are considered when less invasive methods fail or are impossible, or if the obstruction is below the level where intubation can be performed. Nasotracheal intubation might be difficult given the facial trauma history and the tape itself. A CT scan is not the priority when the patient is actively hypoxic and requires immediate airway intervention.\n4.  **Evaluating options:**\n    *   A) Emergent tracheostomy: This is an invasive procedure. While potentially necessary if other methods fail, it's not the *first* step when the obstruction is clearly visible and potentially removable externally.\n    *   B) Emergent cricothyrotomy: Similar to tracheostomy, this is an invasive procedure for establishing an airway when intubation is impossible. It's not the initial step when the obstruction is external and removable.\n    *   C) CT Head: This is irrelevant to the immediate life-threatening airway obstruction. The cause of the hypoxia is clear.\n    *   D) Remove adhesive from his face: This directly addresses the likely cause of the severe airway obstruction. The description notes that removing 1000 layers takes 10 seconds, implying removing 100 layers is very quick (0.1 seconds). This is the fastest and least invasive way to potentially resolve the life-threatening hypoxia.\n    *   E) Prepare for emergent nasotracheal intubation:",

Rural center without imaging.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology:** Inhaling helium causes a temporary change in voice pitch due to the lower density of helium compared to air, which alters the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. This is a physical effect, not typically associated with stroke. Stroke symptoms (like aphasia, dysarthria, facial droop, weakness) are usually more profound and persistent. A NIHSS score of 1, solely based on a voice pitch change after helium inhalation, is highly unlikely to represent an acute ischemic stroke.\n3.  **Standard guidelines:** Stroke protocols (Code Stroke) are initiated based on suspicion of acute stroke. However, the clinical picture here strongly suggests a benign, transient cause (helium inhalation) rather than a neurological emergency.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

This makes it difficult to assess *new* focal deficits accurately.\n    *   **Sedation/Paralysis:** The patient is obtunded and on vecuronium, further obscuring the neurological exam.\n    *   **Bilateral Lower Facial Droop:** This is unusual for a typical unilateral stroke. Bilateral facial weakness suggests a central lesion (e.g., pons, bilateral cortical involvement) or peripheral cause (e.g., Guillain-Barr\u00e9, myasthenia gravis, botulism), but these are less likely in the context of a \"code stroke\".\n    *   **Bilateral Flaccid Weakness with Left Hyperreflexia:** This combination is paradoxical. Flaccid weakness suggests lower motor neuron (LMN) or neuromuscular junction (NMJ) involvement, while hyperreflexia suggests upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement. The presence of left hyperreflexia *despite* bilateral flaccid weakness is particularly concerning and atypical for a standard stroke presentation.\n    *   **High NIHSS Score:** While indicating severity, the score is based on a difficult exam in a patient with pre-existing deficits and paralysis.\n3.  **Standard Diagnostic/Treatment Guidelines:**\n    *   **Acute Stroke Management:** The immediate priority in a suspected acute stroke is to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This is typically done with a non-contrast CT head.\n    *   **Thrombolysis (Tenecte",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease.

Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of severe, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw. He describes the pain as 9/10 in intensity and states that it started while he was resting. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 30-pack-year smoking history. He has no known drug allergies. On examination, he appears diaphoretic and anxious. His vital signs are as follows- blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 70% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is performed, showing 3 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL. His initial troponin I level is 0.08 ng/mL (reference range- <0.04 ng/mL). An echocardiogram is obtained, with report available below.   The echocardiogram report follows: Echocardiogram Report      Patient Name: XXXXXXX     Medical Record Number: XXXXXXX     Date of Study: XXXXXXX     Indication: Evaluation of cardiac function in a 58-year-old male with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)            Findings:      1. Left Ventricle (LV):              Size: Normal         Wall Motion: Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) noted.                      Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.                  Overall Function: Consistent with myocardial ischemia/infarction involving the RCA territory.           2. Mitral Valve:              Structure: Leaflets and chordae appear intact.         Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) noted, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. No evidence of flail leaflet.           3. Right Ventricle (RV):              Size and Function: Normal size with preserved systolic function.           4. Pericardium:              No evidence of pericardial effusion.           5. Atria:              Left Atrium (LA): Normal size.         Right Atrium (RA): Normal size.           6. Aortic Valve:              Structure: Trileaflet, normal opening and closing.         Function: No aortic stenosis or regurgitation observed.           7. Tricuspid Valve:              Function: Trace tricuspid regurgitation (physiologic).         Right Atrial Pressure Estimate: Normal.                 Conclusion:              Severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with regional wall motion abnormalities in the setting of acute inferior STEMI.         Moderately reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) at approximately 40%, suggesting impaired systolic function.         Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction associated with the inferior wall myocardial infarction.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of abdominal pain that began around her umbilicus and has since migrated to the right lower quadrant. She describes the pain as sharp and rates it as 8/10 in intensity. She also reports nausea and has vomited twice. She has no significant past medical history and is not taking any medications. On physical examination, her temperature is 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, heart rate is 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 is 77%. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. The Rovsing sign is positive, and she experiences increased pain with passive extension of the right hip (psoas sign). Laboratory results show a WBC count of 14,000/\u00b5L with a left shift. A CT scan of the abdomen reveals an enlarged appendix with wall thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding, and no evidence of perforation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA) Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe for 24 hours\nB) Give oxygen\nC) Administer intravenous fluids and pain medication\nD) Perform emergent appendectomy\nE) Schedule outpatient follow-up with a general surgeon\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

Her temperature is 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), heart rate is 105 beats per minute, blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 80%. Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,000/mm\u00b3. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant demonstrates gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones. Blood cultures are pending. Her CT Report and Surgeon Consult are as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis Report      Examination: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis.      Clinical Indication: 42-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Evaluate for complications and need for emergent surgical intervention.      Technique:              Axial and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvis after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material.         Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.         Multiple radiodense gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, with one calculus impacted at the gallbladder neck/cystic duct region.         Pericholecystic fluid collections are evident surrounding the gallbladder.         There is significant inflammatory fat stranding in the pericholecystic region.         No evidence of gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen to suggest emphysematous cholecystitis.         No visible perforation or abscess formation at this time.           Biliary Tree:              The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.         The common bile duct measures within normal limits.           Liver:              The liver is normal in size and exhibits homogeneous attenuation.         No focal hepatic lesions are identified.         No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.           Pancreas:              The pancreas is unremarkable in size and contour.         No signs of pancreatitis or peripancreatic fluid collections.           Spleen and Adrenal Glands:              The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal without focal lesions.           Kidneys:              Both kidneys are normal in size and shape.         No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.           Bowel:              The stomach and visualized bowel loops are unremarkable.         No signs of bowel obstruction or ischemia.           Peritoneum:              A small amount of free fluid is present in the peritoneal cavity, likely reactive.           Vasculature:              The abdominal aorta and its major branches are patent.         No aneurysmal dilatation or dissection.           Other Findings:              Lung bases are clear with no pleural effusions.         No free intraperitoneal air is detected.           Impression:              Findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis, evidenced by gallbladder distension, marked wall thickening, hyperenhancement, pericholecystic fluid, and impacted gallstones at the gallbladder neck.         Significant inflammatory changes in the pericholecystic fat suggest ongoing infection and inflammation.         No current evidence of gallbladder perforation, emphysematous cholecystitis, or abscess formation.         Mild reactive ascites noted.                 Surgeon Consult Note:     42-year-old female presents with 12-hour onset of severe RUQ abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder, positive Murphy's sign, temp 101.3\u00b0F, HR 105 bpm, WBC 15,000/mm\u00b3.

Liver:              No evidence of laceration, contusion, or active bleeding.           Kidneys:              No renal injuries detected.           Bowel and Mesentery:              No signs of bowel perforation, obstruction, or mesenteric injury.           Vascular Structures:              Active contrast extravasation from the distal splenic artery branch identified.         No evidence of aortic or other major vessel injury.           Peritoneal Cavity:              Significant hemoperitoneum present, predominantly in the left upper quadrant and pelvis, consistent with ongoing internal bleeding.           Bones:              No pelvic fractures or spinal injuries identified.           Other Organs:              Pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.           Impression:              Grade IV Splenic Injury: Multiple deep lacerations involving the hilum with active contrast extravasation, indicative of ongoing hemorrhage.

Her last menstrual period was approximately 7 weeks ago. On examination, her blood pressure is 85/50 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation is 76.1234%, and she appears pale and diaphoretic. A transvaginal ultrasound reveals no intrauterine pregnancy, but there is a complex adnexal mass and free fluid in the pelvis.  Her CT Abdomen/Pelvis Report follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Intravenous Contrast      Patient: 27-year-old female, G2P1      Clinical Indication:              Patient presents with sudden-onset lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, lightheadedness, and hypotension (BP 85/50 mmHg).         Last menstrual period was approximately 7 weeks ago.         Transvaginal ultrasound revealed no intrauterine pregnancy, a complex right adnexal mass, and free fluid in the pelvis.         Suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy.           Technique:              Contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.           Findings:      Uterus and Adnexa:              The uterus is normal in size and shape with no evidence of intrauterine gestation.         A complex heterogeneous mass measuring approximately 4.5 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm is present in the right adnexa, consistent with an ectopic pregnancy.         The mass exhibits areas of high attenuation, suggestive of active bleeding.           Peritoneal Cavity:              Extensive high-density free fluid is noted throughout the pelvis and abdomen, including the paracolic gutters and subphrenic spaces.         The attenuation values of the fluid are consistent with hemoperitoneum.           Solid Organs:              Liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable with no signs of trauma or pathology.           Bowel and Mesentery:              Normal distribution of gas and fecal matter.         No evidence of obstruction or perforation.           Vasculature:              No aneurysms, dissections, or vascular malformations identified.           Osseous Structures:              No acute fractures or destructive lesions.           Lymph Nodes:              No significant lymphadenopathy.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2. Mesenteric Vasculature:              Evidence of thromboembolic occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery with minimal collateral flow.         The mesenteric fat demonstrates stranding and edema, consistent with vascular compromise and inflammation secondary to ischemia.           3. Peritoneum:              Small volume free fluid within the peritoneal cavity, particularly around the small bowel loops and within the pelvis.         No evidence of free intraperitoneal air to suggest perforation at this time.           4.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 88-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain. He describes the pain as \"the worst pain I've ever felt.\" His vital signs show hypotension (BP 95/60 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 110 bpm), O2 saturation 95%, and elevated respiratory rate (22 breaths per minute). Labs reveal an elevated lactate, and a CT scan suggests acute mesenteric ischemia. Despite the severity of his condition, the patient refuses consent for surgery. The medical team is concerned that his condition is life-threatening and that delaying surgery could lead to bowel necrosis, septic shock, and death. His daughter provides the patient's advance directive which states that he would never consent to any type of surgery stating \"Never have, and never will!\". The patient's mental status appears slightly altered, possibly due to hypoxia or pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA) Give morphine\nB) Give oxygen\nC) Despite patient's refusal to consent the medical team has established the following- 1. The patient's life is at immediate risk and the surgery has a high chance of saving his life. 2. The patient has impaired decision-making capacity likely due to hypoxia and pain which may limit his understanding of the risks of refusing surgery. 3. The medical team has a duty to act in the patient's best interest and waiting for further consent could lead to irreversible harm. Thus, the medical team has the absolute duty to perform surgery against the patient's wishes.\nD) Outpatient surgical exploration\nE) Administer intravenous fluids and pain control\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 28-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by police after being found wandering the streets in a busy downtown area.

Delaying surgery to obtain IV access is not the *most* appropriate next step. If access can be obtained rapidly (e.g., intraosseous), it should be done concurrently with preparing for surgery. However, the question asks for the *most* appropriate next step, and immediate surgery takes precedence over potentially time-consuming IV attempts.\n    *   B) Obtain an abdominal CT scan: CT scans are valuable for evaluating stable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma, but they are contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients as they delay definitive surgical intervention.\n    *   C) Perform",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

She has risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including a recent long-haul flight and unilateral leg swelling/tenderness suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her ECG and chest X-ray are non-diagnostic for other common causes of chest pain and shortness of breath like myocardial infarction or pneumonia. \\n2. **Relevant Pathophysiology:** The combination of acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hypoxemia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and risk factors for VTE (recent travel, potential DVT) is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a thrombus, often originating from a DVT, travels to the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow and causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxemia. \\n3. **Standard Diagnostic Guidelines:** In a patient with intermediate to high clinical probability of PE (based on Wells score or similar criteria, which this patient likely meets given symptoms, tachycardia, and risk factors), the recommended next step is definitive diagnostic imaging. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the gold standard imaging modality for diagnosing PE due to its high sensitivity and specificity. \\n4. **Evaluation of Options:**\\n    A) Albuterol is a bronchodilator used for asthma or COPD exacerbations.

She has risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including a recent long-haul flight and unilateral leg swelling/tenderness suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her ECG and chest X-ray are non-diagnostic for other common causes of chest pain and shortness of breath like myocardial infarction or pneumonia. \\n2. **Relevant Pathophysiology:** The combination of acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hypoxemia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and risk factors for VTE (recent travel, potential DVT) is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a thrombus, often originating from a DVT, travels to the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow and causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to hypoxemia. \\n3. **Standard Diagnostic Guidelines:** In a patient with intermediate to high clinical probability of PE (based on Wells score or similar criteria, which this patient likely meets given symptoms, tachycardia, and risk factors), the recommended next step is definitive diagnostic imaging. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the gold standard imaging modality for diagnosing PE due to its high sensitivity and specificity. \\n4. **Evaluation of Options:**\\n    A) Albuterol is a bronchodilator used for asthma or COPD exacerbations. While the patient is short of breath, there are no signs of bronchospasm, and albuterol would not address the underlying suspected pathology (PE).\\n    B) Opioids might provide some pain relief but are not the primary management step and do not address the life-threatening hypoxemia or the underlying cause.\\n    C) Telemetry monitoring is used to assess cardiac rhythm. While tachycardia is present, it is likely secondary to hypoxemia and PE. Telemetry is not the most crucial next step for diagnosing the primary problem.\\n    D) CT pulmonary angiogram is the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm or exclude PE, which is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and risk factors. Prompt diagnosis is critical as PE can be fatal.\\n    E) Giving oxygen is an important supportive measure to address the hypoxemia (",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status, fever, and difficulty breathing.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Given the persistence of his seizures, he is started on a loading dose of IV Medication B . His seizures do not fully abate, and his condition escalates to refractory status epilepticus. In response, the team initiates a third antiseizure medication, IV Medication C , to achieve seizure control. The combination of Medication A, Medication B , and Medication C finally stabilizes him. Due to the complexity of managing his medication regimen remains high due to the interaction risks and side effects, he is transferred to the ICU. Currently all medications are dosed twice daily at 0000 and 1200. He is now experiencing recurrent seizures. Currently Medication A is given at 0000 and 1200, Medication B at 0400 and 1600, Medication C is given at 0600 and 1800. Medications A and B, if co-administered may be more synergistic with each other and neurology recommends co-administering these with about q12 hour spacing.

The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nYou are seeing a 23 yo patient in epilepsy clinic who has had seizures occurring every hour over the last day. His last seizure was at 10-00 AM and now it is 11-15 AM. His three seizures prior to 10AM were approximately 1, 2,  and 3 hours before that time, in keeping with an hourly seizure occurrence. He asks you when his next seizure will be. What is the best answer?\n\nA) In approximately 1 minutes\nB) In approximately 30 minutes\nC) In approximately one hour\nD) In approximately one day\nE) State the following - I don't know and explain that seizures are unpredictable.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

It's a one-way valve. The sensation of hoarseness *could* be related to airflow dynamics through the PMV or upper airway, or perhaps referred sensation.\n    *   **Smoking:** Increases risk for various respiratory conditions, including COPD (causing wheezing/SOB) and laryngeal/lung cancer.\n    *   **Wheezing/SOB:** Suggests airway obstruction or inflammation, potentially related to smoking (COPD) or the new virus (D).\n    *   **New Virus (D):** Causes *laryngeal* inflammation and voice changes. This is key. Even though the patient's larynx was removed, the virus *could* still affect the upper airway (pharynx, trachea) or cause systemic symptoms mimicking respiratory issues. The \"hoarseness\" sensation might be an early indicator (Q) of this viral infection affecting the remaining upper airway structures.\n    *   **Paradoxical Hoarseness:** The patient *cannot* be hoarse in the traditional sense (vocal cord issue).

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Presents with a sudden decrease in swimming speed (worse than baseline, similar to age-matched peers), headache, and dysarthria. Concerned about stroke. BP is 160/90.\n2.  **Relevant Pathophysiology:** The patient has multiple risk factors for stroke (age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The sudden onset of neurological symptoms (decreased swimming speed, headache, dysarthria) raises suspicion for stroke. However, the patient is using a TMS device, which uses magnetic pulses to stimulate brain activity. TMS can potentially cause neurological side effects, including headache, muscle twitching, and, rarely, seizures. The device is located on the right temple, which could affect the left hemisphere, potentially impacting motor control and speech (dysarthria). The decreased swimming speed could be related to motor impairment or cognitive changes. The patient's pre-existing dysarthria is also relevant.\n3.  **Standard Diagnostic/Treatment Guidelines:** For suspected stroke, immediate evaluation including vital signs, neurological exam, EKG, and neuroimaging (CT or MRI) is crucial.

Uses a noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device on his right temple to augment swimming speed. Presents with a sudden decrease in swimming speed (worse than baseline, similar to age-matched peers), headache, and dysarthria. Concerned about stroke. BP is 160/90.\n2.  **Relevant Pathophysiology:** The patient has multiple risk factors for stroke (age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The sudden onset of neurological symptoms (decreased swimming speed, headache, dysarthria) raises suspicion for stroke. However, the patient is using a TMS device, which uses magnetic pulses to stimulate brain activity. TMS can potentially cause neurological side effects, including headache, muscle twitching, and, rarely, seizures. The device is located on the right temple, which could affect the left hemisphere, potentially impacting motor control and speech (dysarthria). The decreased swimming speed could be related to motor impairment or cognitive changes. The patient's pre-existing dysarthria is also relevant.\n3.  **Standard Diagnostic/Treatment Guidelines:** For suspected stroke, immediate evaluation including vital signs, neurological exam, EKG, and neuroimaging (CT or MRI) is crucial. For headache and dysarthria, further investigation is needed. Given the TMS device use, its potential role in the symptoms must be considered.\n4.  **Option Analysis:**\n    *   **A) Aspirin:** Aspirin is indicated for acute ischemic stroke, but a diagnosis hasn't been made yet. Administering aspirin without confirming stroke type (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic) or ruling out other causes could be harmful.\n    *   **B) EKG:** An EKG is important in the workup of stroke to evaluate for atrial fibrillation or other cardiac causes of emboli. However, it doesn't directly address the immediate concern of stroke vs. other causes like TMS side effects or a primary neurological event.\n    *   **C) MRI Brain:** MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting acute ischemic stroke and can also identify other structural abnormalities or causes of the symptoms. It would be a definitive diagnostic step.\n    *   **D) Check his device:** The patient is using a TMS device, and his symptoms (headache, dysarthria, decreased motor performance) could potentially be side",

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis.

Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nYou are the chief resident in a busy hospital's trauma unit during a particularly chaotic evening shift. A massive car accident has just occurred, bringing in ten critically injured patients who all require immediate blood transfusions. However, you are informed that there is only a limited supply of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) available. One of your patients, Patient X, is a 35-year-old woman with a chronic hematologic condition who requires 20 pRBCs each month to maintain her health and avoid severe complications. Now, you must make a critical decision- You have the option to allocate the 20 pRBCs that were scheduled for Patient X to the ten new trauma patients, each of whom requires two transfusion to survive. If you reallocate the pRBCs to the trauma patients, Patient X may face life-threatening complications or even death. However, if you do not reallocate the pRBCs, the ten trauma patients are at high risk of dying from their injuries. You recall that you were trained in deontology. Which option do you pick from the standpoint of helping the most people (choose only one option)?\n\nA) Reallocate the 20 pRBCs to the ten trauma patients prioritizing immediate life-saving measures for the patients who are critically injured.\nB) Provide the 20 pRBCs to Patient X as she has an established medical need and has been relying on this treatment for her chronic condition.\nC) Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies.\nD) Ask your medical student for advice.\nE) Go home because this is stressful.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

The snake is identified as non-venomous.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms:** The snake is constricting the arm, leading to compression of blood vessels (arterial and venous) and nerves. The loss of radial pulse indicates arterial occlusion. The bluish discoloration suggests venous congestion and impaired oxygen delivery. Loss of sensation indicates nerve compression. The primary danger is ischemic injury to the limb due to lack of blood flow. The patient's bipolar disorder is a relevant factor as it might affect her judgment or behavior, but the immediate priority is the limb-threatening situation.\n3.  **Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines:** The immediate management of constrictor injuries focuses on removing the constrictor to restore blood flow. Delaying removal can lead to permanent nerve damage, muscle necrosis, and potentially limb loss. Diagnostic imaging (X-ray) is not the priority. Chemical immobilization (phenobarbital) is not appropriate for this situation and could delay definitive treatment.

He is on warfarin and aspirin (anticoagulants).

This likely affects gastrointestinal motility and anatomy, potentially leading to issues like bowel obstruction, volvulus, or malabsorption.

(systolic), HR 180 bpm, poor perfusion signs (reduced pulse pressure in feet), elevated resistive indices on echo.\n2.  **Pathophysiology:** SIVS involves recalibration of vestibular centers, leading to preference for inverted positions. The acute event (syncope/dizziness) upon change of position suggests orthostatic hypotension, but the extremely high BP (280 systolic) in the handstand position points towards a different mechanism. The high BP and tachycardia in an inverted position, coupled with poor perfusion distally (feet), suggest a hypertensive emergency or crisis, potentially related to the aortic aneurysm and the unusual hemodynamic stress imposed by the inverted position. The elevated resistive indices suggest increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which is paradoxical given the poor distal perfusion. The high HR suggests a compensatory mechanism or a primary tachyarrhythmia. The syncope could be due to cerebral hypoperfusion despite the high systemic BP (e.g., due to baroreceptor failure or paradoxical response). The aortic aneurysm is a critical factor, as extreme hypertension can lead to dissection or rupture.\n3.  **Standard guidelines:** No standard guidelines exist for SIVS.

Patient complains of pain in the left arm.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology:** The patient has a history of hypertension, suggesting underlying vascular disease. The extremely high BP readings are concerning for hypertensive emergency. However, the BP is measured on the arm that is severely broken and painful. Pain can significantly elevate blood pressure readings (pseudo-hypertension). The fact that the patient was born without a right arm means there is no alternative arm to measure BP on.\n3.  **Standard diagnostic/treatment guidelines:** In a situation with suspected pseudo-hypertension, the first step is to confirm the BP reading using a different method or location if possible. If the arm is injured or painful, the reading is unreliable. Treating based on an unreliable reading could be harmful.\n4.  **Evaluating the options:**\n    *   A) IV labetalol: This is treatment for hypertensive emergency.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 70 yo male presents to the emergency department with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior oropharanx injury and complete nasal obstruction from prior motorcycle accident.

Last known normal was 30 minutes ago, immediately preceding inhalation of helium. NIHSS score is 1 (mild deficit) due to voice pitch change.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms:** Helium is a light gas that, when inhaled, temporarily changes the resonant frequency of the vocal tract, causing the voice to sound higher pitched (\"helium voice\"). This effect is transient and resolves quickly after stopping helium inhalation and breathing normal air. The patient's symptoms started *immediately* after inhaling helium, and the only neurological finding is a change in voice pitch, which is consistent with the known physiological effect of helium inhalation.

This effect is transient and resolves quickly after stopping helium inhalation and breathing normal air.

The anisocoria with a dilated, unreactive pupil is highly concerning for oculomotor nerve (CN III) compression, often due to transtentorial herniation from a rapidly expanding intracranial mass (e.g., hemorrhage, large infarct with edema).

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\n70 yo male with history of MVA 20 years ago with resultant, spinal injury, chronic left sided weakness, right lower facial droop, ESRD on HD.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of severe, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw. He describes the pain as 9/10 in intensity and states that it started while he was resting. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 30-pack-year smoking history. He has no known drug allergies. On examination, he appears diaphoretic and anxious. His vital signs are as follows- blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 70% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is performed, showing 3 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL. His initial troponin I level is 0.08 ng/mL (reference range- <0.04 ng/mL). An echocardiogram is obtained, with report available below.   The echocardiogram report follows: Echocardiogram Report      Patient Name: XXXXXXX     Medical Record Number: XXXXXXX     Date of Study: XXXXXXX     Indication: Evaluation of cardiac function in a 58-year-old male with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)            Findings:      1. Left Ventricle (LV):              Size: Normal         Wall Motion: Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) noted.                      Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.                  Overall Function: Consistent with myocardial ischemia/infarction involving the RCA territory.           2. Mitral Valve:              Structure: Leaflets and chordae appear intact.         Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) noted, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. No evidence of flail leaflet.           3. Right Ventricle (RV):              Size and Function: Normal size with preserved systolic function.           4. Pericardium:              No evidence of pericardial effusion.           5. Atria:              Left Atrium (LA): Normal size.         Right Atrium (RA): Normal size.           6. Aortic Valve:              Structure: Trileaflet, normal opening and closing.         Function: No aortic stenosis or regurgitation observed.           7. Tricuspid Valve:              Function: Trace tricuspid regurgitation (physiologic).         Right Atrial Pressure Estimate: Normal.                 Conclusion:              Severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with regional wall motion abnormalities in the setting of acute inferior STEMI.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 58-year-old man presents with a 2-hour history of severe, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw on your airplane. He describes the pain as 9/10 in intensity and states that it started while he was resting. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 30-pack-year smoking history. He has no known drug allergies. On examination, he appears diaphoretic and anxious. His vital signs are as follows- blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 80% on room air. Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is performed, showing 3 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL. His initial troponin I level is 0.08 ng/mL (reference range- <0.04 ng/mL). Echocardiogram is obtained with results available below. Here are the echocardiogram results. Echocardiogram Report      Patient Name: XXXXXXX     Medical Record Number: XXXXXXX     Date of Study: XXXXXXX     Indication: Evaluation of cardiac function in a 58-year-old male with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)            Findings:      1. Left Ventricle (LV):              Size: Normal         Wall Motion: Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) noted.                      Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.                  Overall Function: Consistent with myocardial ischemia/infarction involving the RCA territory.           2. Mitral Valve:              Structure: Leaflets and chordae appear intact.         Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) noted, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. No evidence of flail leaflet.           3. Right Ventricle (RV):              Size and Function: Normal size with preserved systolic function.           4. Pericardium:              No evidence of pericardial effusion.           5. Atria:              Left Atrium (LA): Normal size.         Right Atrium (RA): Normal size.           6. Aortic Valve:              Structure: Trileaflet, normal opening and closing.         Function: No aortic stenosis or regurgitation observed.           7. Tricuspid Valve:              Function: Trace tricuspid regurgitation (physiologic).         Right Atrial Pressure Estimate: Normal.                 Conclusion:              Severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with regional wall motion abnormalities in the setting of acute inferior STEMI.         Moderately reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) at approximately 40%, suggesting impaired systolic function.         Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction associated with the inferior wall myocardial infarction.         No evidence of pericardial effusion.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

Her temperature is 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), heart rate is 105 beats per minute, blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 80%. Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,000/mm\u00b3. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant demonstrates gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones. Blood cultures are pending. Her CT Report and Surgeon Consult are as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis Report      Examination: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis.      Clinical Indication: 42-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Evaluate for complications and need for emergent surgical intervention.      Technique:              Axial and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvis after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material.         Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.         Multiple radiodense gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, with one calculus impacted at the gallbladder neck/cystic duct region.         Pericholecystic fluid collections are evident surrounding the gallbladder.         There is significant inflammatory fat stranding in the pericholecystic region.         No evidence of gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen to suggest emphysematous cholecystitis.         No visible perforation or abscess formation at this time.           Biliary Tree:              The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.         The common bile duct measures within normal limits.           Liver:              The liver is normal in size and exhibits homogeneous attenuation.         No focal hepatic lesions are identified.         No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.           Pancreas:              The pancreas is unremarkable in size and contour.         No signs of pancreatitis or peripancreatic fluid collections.           Spleen and Adrenal Glands:              The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal without focal lesions.           Kidneys:              Both kidneys are normal in size and shape.         No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.           Bowel:              The stomach and visualized bowel loops are unremarkable.         No signs of bowel obstruction or ischemia.           Peritoneum:              A small amount of free fluid is present in the peritoneal cavity, likely reactive.           Vasculature:              The abdominal aorta and its major branches are patent.         No aneurysmal dilatation or dissection.           Other Findings:              Lung bases are clear with no pleural effusions.         No free intraperitoneal air is detected.           Impression:              Findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis, evidenced by gallbladder distension, marked wall thickening, hyperenhancement, pericholecystic fluid, and impacted gallstones at the gallbladder neck.         Significant inflammatory changes in the pericholecystic fat suggest ongoing infection and inflammation.         No current evidence of gallbladder perforation, emphysematous cholecystitis, or abscess formation.         Mild reactive ascites noted.                 Surgeon Consult Note:     42-year-old female presents with 12-hour onset of severe RUQ abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder, positive Murphy's sign, temp 101.3\u00b0F, HR 105 bpm, WBC 15,000/mm\u00b3.

This addresses a life-threatening issue.\n    *   **C) Perform outpatient percutaneous cholecystostomy:** This is an option for patients who are too unstable or high-risk for surgery, but it's not the first-line treatment for a relatively young patient who is otherwise likely a surgical candidate, and it doesn't address the immediate hemodynamic instability.\n    *   **D) Perform emergent cholecystectomy:** While cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment, performing surgery on a hemodynamically unstable and hypoxic patient is extremely high-risk. Stabilization must occur",

Physical examination reveals significant tenderness and guarding in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. A Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam is positive for free intraperitoneal fluid. His hemoglobin level has dropped from 14 g/dL pre-accident to 8 g/dL on admission. A CT Abdomen/Pelvis is obtained. His CT Report follows:   CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Intravenous Contrast      Clinical History:              28-year-old male involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision.         Presents with hypotension (BP 75/45 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 130 bpm), left upper quadrant tenderness, and a significant drop in hemoglobin from 14 g/dL to 8 g/dL.         FAST exam positive for free intraperitoneal fluid.           Technique:              Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed.         Intravenous contrast administered; arterial, venous, and delayed phases acquired.           Findings:      Spleen:              Laceration: Multiple deep lacerations noted in the mid and lower poles, extending to the hilum.         Active Bleeding: Active contrast extravasation within the splenic parenchyma observed on the arterial phase, indicating active hemorrhage.         Hematoma: Subcapsular and intraparenchymal hematomas present, measuring up to 5 cm in thickness.         Vascular Involvement: Possible involvement of the splenic artery branches with irregular contrast flow.           Liver:              No evidence of laceration, contusion, or active bleeding.           Kidneys:              No renal injuries detected.           Bowel and Mesentery:              No signs of bowel perforation, obstruction, or mesenteric injury.           Vascular Structures:              Active contrast extravasation from the distal splenic artery branch identified.         No evidence of aortic or other major vessel injury.           Peritoneal Cavity:              Significant hemoperitoneum present, predominantly in the left upper quadrant and pelvis, consistent with ongoing internal bleeding.           Bones:              No pelvic fractures or spinal injuries identified.           Other Organs:              Pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.

      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Laboratory studies show elevated TSH and low free T4. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 88-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain. He describes the pain as \"the worst pain I've ever felt.\" His vital signs show hypotension (BP 95/60 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 110 bpm), O2 saturation 95%, and elevated respiratory rate (22 breaths per minute). Labs reveal an elevated lactate, and a CT scan suggests acute mesenteric ischemia. Despite the severity of his condition, the patient refuses consent for surgery. The medical team is concerned that his condition is life-threatening and that delaying surgery could lead to bowel necrosis, septic shock, and death. His daughter provides the patient's advance directive which states that he would never consent to any type of surgery stating \"Never have, and never will!\". The patient's mental status appears slightly altered, possibly due to hypoxia or pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA) Give morphine\nB) Give oxygen\nC) Despite patient's refusal to consent the medical team has established the following- 1. The patient's life is at immediate risk and the surgery has a high chance of saving his life. 2. The patient has impaired decision-making capacity likely due to hypoxia and pain which may limit his understanding of the risks of refusing surgery. 3. The medical team has a duty to act in the patient's best interest and waiting for further consent could lead to irreversible harm.

The history of right facial droop might suggest a pre-existing LMN lesion on the right, but the current finding is bilateral.\n\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms:**\n    *   Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) is a common cause of acute neurological deficits.\n    *   Ischemic stroke: Blockage of a blood vessel leading to brain tissue death. Treatment often involves thrombolysis (like tenecteplase) or thrombectomy if within the appropriate time window and meeting criteria.\n    *   Hemorrhagic stroke: Bleeding into the brain. Thrombolysis is contraindicated.\n    *   The patient's presentation is atypical for a standard stroke. Bilateral deficits, flaccid weakness, and the specific pattern of hyperreflexia (left side only) raise concerns about other possibilities or a very unusual stroke pattern (e.g., brainstem involvement, bilateral hemispheric involvement, spinal cord lesion exacerbated by brain event).\n    *   The history of spinal injury and chronic weakness complicates the assessment of new neurological deficits.\n    *   The patient is obtunded, which is a significant finding requiring immediate attention.\n\n3.  **Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines:**\n    *   For a suspected acute stroke, the immediate priority is to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.\n",

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 24-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after being stabbed in the abdomen.

The distended and tender abdomen strongly suggests intra-abdominal bleeding or injury.\n3.  **Relevant pathophysiology:** Penetrating abdominal trauma carries a high risk of significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage and organ injury.

Diagnostic procedures like CT scans or DPL are generally contraindicated or deferred in unstable patients because they delay definitive surgical management.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Graves' disease\nB) Hashimoto's thyroiditis\nC) Thyroid adenoma\nD) Subacute thyroiditis\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid adenoma typically presents as a nodule and doesn't usually cause hypothyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nA 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of sharp, left-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing and is associated with sudden-onset shortness of breath. She denies any recent trauma or fever. Her past medical history includes controlled hypertension and a recent history of a long-haul flight two weeks ago. Additionally, she reports mild leg swelling in her left calf over the past few days. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. On physical examination, her vital signs are as follows- temperature of 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure of 128/76 mmHg, pulse of 110/min, respiratory rate of 22/min, and SpO\u2082 of 86% on room air. Cardiac examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung examination is unremarkable. Examination of the left lower extremity reveals mild calf tenderness and swelling compared to the right. An electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia without ST-T changes, and a chest X-ray is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA) Albuterol\nB) Prescribe a short course of opioids\nC) Admit for telemetry monitoring\nD) Arrange for a CT pulmonary angiogram\nE) Give oxygen\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Subacute thyroiditis can cause transient hypothyroidism but typically presents with pain and follows a viral illness.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents with hemoptysis and a 3 cm lung mass on chest CT. Biopsy shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nYou are evaluating a 30-year-old male patient who had larynx removed at age 5 (X), which has resulted in chronic inability to speak (CC). The patient also has a history of heavy smoking (Y) and reports occasional wheezing and shortness of breath. His chief complaint is hoarseness sensation (CC) when using his Passy-muir valve which is anatomically typically below the larynx. On examination, you notice the patient is experiencing mild wheezing (P). It is the year 2030, and there is a new flu-like virus (D) that is known to cause acute laryngeal inflammation and voice changes, with initial weak indicators (Q) including hoarseness. What is the best course of action?\n\nA) CT scan of the neck to rule out laryngeal cancer\nB) MRI to evaluate vocal cord paralysis\nC) Surgery to reconstruct the larynx\nD) Test for the new flu-like virus by swabbing his larynx\nE) Administer supportive care for respiratory symptoms and monitor response to treatment.\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze this medical question carefully.

The lab findings confirm primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH (the pituitary is trying to stimulate the thyroid) and low free T4 (the thyroid is not producing enough hormone). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. Graves' disease causes hyperthyroidism.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA) Surgical resection\nB) Radiation therapy alone\nC) Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide\nD) Observation with repeat imaging in 3 months\n\n**Answer:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The biopsy showing small round blue cells in a smoker with a lung mass is diagnostic of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is highly aggressive but initially chemosensitive. Unlike non-small cell lung cancer, surgical resection is not typically indicated for SCLC because it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. The standard first-line treatment is combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide, often combined with radiation for limited-stage disease. Observation would be inappropriate given the aggressive nature of this malignancy.\n\n## Medical Question\n\nThe year is 2050, and you are examining a 70 yo with hypertension, hyperlipidema, chronic dysarthria, and migraines in the family medicine clinic who has his swimming speed augmented via an MRI compatible noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation device, located on his right temple. Daughter says his swimming speed isnow  similar to his pre-augmentation agility. The patient complains that he woke up swimming much slower and wonders if he's having a stroke. Exam is notable for BP of 160/90, and his swim speed is slower than would be expected for a 30 year-old (such as yourself), and potentially at the same level to be expected for a 60-70 year-old age-range. The review of systems notable for headache and dysarthria. Labs are notable only for elevated fasting lipids.

BP is 160/90.\n2.  **Relevant Pathophysiology:** The patient has multiple risk factors for stroke (age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The sudden onset of neurological symptoms (decreased swimming speed, headache, dysarthria) raises suspicion for stroke. However, the patient is using a TMS device, which uses magnetic pulses to stimulate brain activity. TMS can potentially cause neurological side effects, including headache, muscle twitching, and, rarely, seizures.

On warfarin.\n2.  **Relevant pathophysiology and mechanisms:** The patient has a complex presentation involving potential stroke (given history, risk factors, and NIHSS score) and a mechanical prosthetic arm. The arm's failure could be due to a neurological event (stroke affecting the control pathway, although the arm is controlled by the *right* hand, implying a central control issue or a peripheral issue related to the graft interface), or a mechanical/electrical failure of the prosthetic device itself. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and warfarin use increases the risk of stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic). The elevated BP could be a consequence of the event or a contributing factor.\n3.  **Standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines:** In a patient presenting with acute neurological deficits suggestive of stroke, rapid evaluation is crucial.
