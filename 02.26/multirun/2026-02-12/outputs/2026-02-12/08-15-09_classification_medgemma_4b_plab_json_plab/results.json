Flucloxacillin is a reasonable first-line choice. However, the question asks for what *other* medications to add. Given the potential for MRSA or other resistant organisms, and the severity of the infection, a broader-spectrum antibiotic is indicated. Ciprofloxacin provides good coverage against Gram-negative bacteria, including some MRSA strains, and is a suitable addition to the initial treatment.

      "reasoning": "The presentation suggests cellulitis, a common bacterial skin infection. Flucloxacillin is an appropriate initial antibiotic for this, but a broader spectrum agent is needed to cover potential MRSA or other resistant organisms, especially if the infection is severe or unresponsive to flucloxacillin. Ciprofloxacin covers Gram-negative organisms and some Gram-positive organisms, including some MRSA strains, and is a reasonable choice. Gentamicin covers Gram-negative organisms but has no Gram-positive coverage. Metronidazole is an anaerobic antibiotic and not usually first-line for cellulitis. Benzylpenicillin is not a good choice for cellulitis, especially with the availability of more effective and safer options. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, but ciprofloxacin is a more appropriate initial choice for this presentation.",

      "prompt": "## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nA 24-year-old woman at 10 weeks gestation presents with persistent vomiting, ketonuria, and weight loss. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA) Acute gastroenteritis\nB) Hyperemesis gravidarum\nC) Urinary tract infection\nD) Peptic ulcer disease\n\n**Answer:** B\n\n**Reasoning:** Early pregnancy with severe vomiting, ketonuria, and weight loss is classic for hyperemesis gravidarum rather than simple nausea/vomiting of pregnancy or non-obstetric causes.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA 68-year-old man has sudden, painless complete vision loss in one eye. Fundoscopy shows a pale retina with a cherry-red spot. What is the diagnosis?\n\nA) Central retinal artery occlusion\nB) Retinal detachment\nC) Optic neuritis\nD) Acute angle-closure glaucoma\n\n**Answer:** A\n\n**Reasoning:** Painless sudden monocular vision loss with a cherry-red spot indicates central retinal artery occlusion.\n\n## PLAB Clinical Question\n\n1169.
