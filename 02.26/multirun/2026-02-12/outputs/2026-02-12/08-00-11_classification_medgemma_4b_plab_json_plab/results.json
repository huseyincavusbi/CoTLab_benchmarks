While acute otitis media (AOM) can cause ear pain, the pre-auricular swelling is less common. Acute otitis externa (AOE) would not typically cause pre-auricular swelling. Mumps can cause parotitis which could cause swelling, but the acute ear pain is more indicative of a local ear infection. The cherry-red spot in the retina is not associated with any of the options.

PID can cause pelvic pain, but the cyclical nature and post-coital component are more characteristic of endometriosis. Pelvic congestion syndrome can cause chronic pelvic pain, but is less likely to be the cause of the cyclical and post-coital symptoms. Adenomyosis is associated with heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea, but is less likely to cause the described pain pattern. Premature ovarian failure would not cause cyclical pelvic pain.",

Endometrial sampling is not the initial investigation of choice for heavy bleeding. Hysteroscopy is invasive and not usually the first line investigation. Pelvic ultrasound is helpful but transvaginal US is more specific for identifying the cause of heavy bleeding in a female patient.",
