The symptoms of Fragile X syndrome include hypogonadism, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems, which align with the patient's ADHD diagnosis.\n\nC) CTG trinucleotide repeat disorder: This is less likely. CTG repeat disorders are associated with myotonic dystrophy, which typically presents with myotonia, cataracts, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. The patient'",

The most common cause of congenital hyperthyroidism is a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, which is a rare but serious condition.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA) Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods: While these are generally healthy choices, they are not directly related to the underlying cause of congenital hyperthyroidism.\n\nB) Changing to a soy based formula: Soy formulas are not known to cause congenital hyperthyroidism.\n\nC) Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement: Imiglucerase is used to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder, and is not relevant to congenital hyperthyroidism.\n\nD) Removing phenylalanine from maternal diet during pregnancy: This is the correct answer. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. If a mother with PKU consumes a diet high in phenylalanine, the fetus can be exposed to high levels of phenylalanine, which can lead to a variety of developmental problems",

This test assesses the function of the trigeminal and facial nerve pathways, which are part of the brainstem. If the patient can blink in response to corneal stimulation, it indicates that the brainstem is functioning.\n\nB) Conjugate eye movement to the left with rotation of the head to the right: This is a test of conjugate eye movement, which involves the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and the abducens nerve (CN VI). This test assesses the function of the oculomotor and abducens nerve pathways, which are part of the brainstem. If the patient can move both eyes in the same direction when the head is rotated, it indicates that the brainstem is functioning.\n\nC) Flexion of the thigh,",

Atopic dermatitis usually presents with pruritus and a characteristic eczematous rash, often on the flexural areas.\n*   **Lichen planus:** This is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes the nails. The characteristic finding is the \"Wickham's striae,\" which are fine, white lines on the surface of the lesions. The patient's presentation aligns well with lichen planus.\n*   **Prurigo nodularis:** This is a skin",

The combination of back pain, radicular pain, bilateral lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and urinary retention is highly suggestive of cauda equina syndrome. The absence of reflexes is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nC) L5/S1 disc herniation - This is also a strong contender. The location of the pain (posterior thigh), the specific weakness (hip extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion), and the sensory loss (posterolateral legs, lateral feet) all point to an L5/",

The weakness could be due to deconditioning, malnutrition, or a more serious underlying cause related to the lung disease.\n\nA) Blood laboratory test: A blood test is a general test and can provide information about overall health, but it is unlikely to directly elucidate the cause of the weakness. It could show anemia or other abnormalities, but it won't pinpoint the specific problem.\n\nB) CT scan of the chest: A CT scan of the chest would be helpful to evaluate the extent of the lung disease, identify any structural abnormalities, and assess for complications like emphysema or bronchiectasis. This is a reasonable choice to further evaluate the lung disease.\n\nC) Electromyography (EMG): EMG is used to assess the function of muscles and nerves. It is useful for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or motor neuron disease. While weakness is a symptom, the patient",

The patient has a medical history of surgical repair of his Achilles tendon, ACL, and medial meniscus. He is currently not taking any medications. The patient lives with his wife and they both practice a vegan lifestyle. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 114/72 mmHg, pulse is 81/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical exam, the patient states that he is currently not experiencing any pain in his foot but rather is experiencing numbness/tingling along the plantar surface of his foot. Strength is 5/5 and reflexes are 2+ in the lower extremities.

In fact, fibroids can cause heavy bleeding and menorrhagia.\n\nB) Endometrial cancer: The patient's sister has endometriosis, which is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. However, the patient's primary issue is uterine fibroids. While fibroids can cause abnormal bleeding, they are not directly linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nC) Iron deficiency anemia: Uterine fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) or bleeding between periods (metrorrhagia). This can lead to iron deficiency anemia.\n\nD) Uterine prolapse: Uterine prolapse is a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and ligaments, causing the uterus to descend into the vaginal canal.

Anorexia nervosa is a common cause of hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to amenorrhea.\n\nB) Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: This is a very likely diagnosis given the patient's age, activity level, and lack of other obvious causes. The hypothalamus controls the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn stimulates the pituitary to release LH and FSH. In functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, there is a disruption in the normal feedback loop, leading to decreased LH and FSH, and subsequently decreased estrogen production. This can result in amenorrhea.\n\nC) Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea, but it is less likely in this case. The patient's temperature is normal, and there are no other signs or symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism.\n\nD",

He feels guilty for not spending more time with his wife before she died. He was recently fired for making several major bookkeeping mistakes at work as an accountant as he had trouble focusing.

There is a recent measles outbreak at the patient's school, and the mother is trying to give her daughter medicine to prevent measles. The patient's temperature is normal, and the neurological exam is normal. Fundoscopic exam reveals mild bilateral papilledema. An MRI of the head reveals cerebral edema. A lumbar puncture reveals an increased opening pressure with a normal glucose level.\n\nThe key findings are the severe headache, the recent measles outbreak, the presence of papilledema, and the increased opening pressure on lumbar puncture. These findings strongly suggest increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA) Bacterial meningitis: While bacterial meningitis can cause headache and increased ICP, the normal glucose level in the CSF makes this less likely. Bacterial meningitis typically presents with low CSF glucose.\n\nB) Fat-soluble vitamin overuse: This is a less likely cause of the acute presentation. Vitamin A, D, E, and K toxicity can cause increased ICP, but the onset is usually more gradual.\n\nC) Migraine headache: Migraines can",

The most likely finding given the patient's history of depression treated with fluoxetine and lithium is a skin lesion.\n\nThe most common skin lesion associated with fluoxetine is a blue-gray discoloration of the skin, often on the shins. This is due to the drug's inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and subsequent accumulation of tyramine.\n\nThe most common skin lesion associated with lithium is a hyperpigmentation of the skin, often on the shins.

The absence of a palpable mass makes DCIS less likely, although it cannot be entirely ruled out without imaging.\n\n*   **B) Intraductal papilloma:** This is a benign growth within a milk duct. It is a very common cause of spontaneous, often bloody, nipple discharge, especially in women of reproductive age. The absence of a palpable mass is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n*   **C) Invasive ductal carcinoma:** This is a type of invasive breast cancer. While it can cause nipple discharge, it is less likely to be the *initial* presentation without a palpable mass or other concerning signs. The absence of a mass makes this less likely.\n\n*   **D) Mammary duct ectasia:** This involves the widening and inflammation of milk ducts. It can cause nipple discharge, but it is more commonly associated with pain and inflammation of",

The patient is 15 years old, and emergency contraception is generally available to minors.\nB) Obtain parental consent before providing emergency contraception: This is incorrect. While parental consent is often required for certain medical procedures, emergency contraception is generally considered a minor procedure and is often provided without parental consent, especially when the patient is of age and can make her own decisions.\nC) Prescribe high-dose oral contraceptives: This is incorrect. High-dose oral contraceptives are not used as emergency contraception.\nD) Prescribe levonorgestrel pill: This is correct. Levonorgestrel pills (Plan B) are a common and effective form of emergency contraception.\nE) Prescribe misoprostol pill: This is incorrect. Misoprostol is used",

The recent clindamycin use is a significant clue, as clindamycin is known to cause *Clostridioides difficile* (formerly *Clostridium difficile*) infection (CDI), also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The absence of fever, abdominal pain, and signs of peritonitis makes a severe CDI less likely, but does not rule it out.\n\nA) Abdominal radiograph: While an abdominal radiograph can be useful in some cases of diarrhea (e.g., to rule out obstruction), it is not the most appropriate initial test for suspected CDI. It is not sensitive or specific enough to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nB) CT imaging of abdomen and pelvis: CT imaging is generally not indicated for uncomplicated diarrhea. It is more appropriate for evaluating more serious abdominal conditions, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nC) Flexible sigmoidoscopy: Flexible sigmoidoscopy can be used to visualize the rectum and sigmoid colon, which are common sites of *C. difficile* infection. It can also be used to obtain biopsies for histological examination. However, it is more invasive than other options and is not typically the first-line diagnostic test.\n\nD",

The laboratory findings are crucial. The glucose level is very low (29 mg/dL), which confirms hypoglycemia. The C-peptide level is significantly elevated (55 ng/mL), which is a strong indicator of endogenous insulin production. The sulfonylurea level is undetectable, ruling out a sulfonylurea overdose.\n\nNow let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA) Alpha cell tumor: Alpha cell tumors produce glucagon, which would cause hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. This is incorrect.\n\nB) Beta cell destruction: Beta cell destruction would lead to a lack of insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia. This is incorrect.\n\nC) Beta cell tumor: Beta cell tumors are rare. While they could theoretically produce insulin, the C-peptide level is very high, which is more consistent with endogenous insulin production. This is less likely than a sulfonylurea overdose.
