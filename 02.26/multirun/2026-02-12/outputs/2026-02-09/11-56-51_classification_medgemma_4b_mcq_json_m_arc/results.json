The sodium is high (148), indicating hypernatremia, and potassium is slightly low (3.4), which is not as critical as the low blood pressure. The ECG shows bradycardia and reduced ejection fraction, suggesting possible heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The low blood pressure is likely due to hypovolemia.\n\nThe options are:\n\n*   **A) Give IVF with normal saline:** Normal saline is an isotonic solution and would be appropriate for volume resuscitation in hypovolemic shock.\n*   **B) Give IVF with D5W:** D5W is a hypotonic solution. Giving a hypotonic solution in this situation could worsen the hypernatremia and potentially cause fluid shifts, which is not desirable.\n*   **C) Epinephrine:** Epinephrine is a vasopressor and inotrope. While it might temporarily increase blood pressure, it doesn't address the underlying hypovolemia and could be harmful in this patient.\n*   **D) Dobutamine:** Dobutamine is an inotrope that increases cardiac contractility. It is not the primary treatment for hypovolemia.\n*   **E) Acquire more clinical data:** While more data is always helpful, the patient is unstable and needs immediate intervention. Delaying treatment to acquire more data is not appropriate.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and the likely cause of hypotension (hypovolemia), the best immediate course of action is to address the hypovolemia with intravenous fluids.

The key findings are the acute inability to use the right arm, reduced activities of daily living with the right arm, and reversal of vision metamorphopsia (RVM). The most likely diagnosis is a radial nerve injury.

Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.                  Overall Function: Consistent with myocardial ischemia/infarction involving the RCA territory.           2. Mitral Valve:              Structure: Leaflets and chordae appear intact.         Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) noted, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. No evidence of flail leaflet.           3. Right Ventricle (RV):              Size and Function: Normal size with preserved systolic function.           4. Pericardium:              No evidence of pericardial effusion.           5. Atria:              Left Atrium (LA): Normal size.         Right Atrium (RA): Normal size.           6. Aortic Valve:              Structure: Trileaflet, normal opening and closing.         Function: No aortic stenosis or regurgitation observed.           7. Tricuspid Valve:              Function: Trace tricuspid regurgitation (physiologic).         Right Atrial Pressure Estimate: Normal.

Initial treatment includes IV lorazepam, which briefly interrupts the seizures, but they recur within minutes.Given the persistence of his seizures, he is started on a loading dose of IV fosphenytoin. Although this initially reduces the frequency of his seizures, they do not fully abate, and his condition escalates to refractory status epilepticus. In response, the team initiates a third antiseizure medication, IV phenobarbital, to achieve seizure control. The combination of clobazam, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital finally stabilizes him, but the complexity of managing his medication regimen remains high due to the interaction risks and side effects, necessitating careful monitoring in the ICU. Currently all are dosed twice daily at 0000 and 1200. He experiences hypotension immediately 2-3 hrs after each dosing and the ICU requests to have these staggered to reduce hypotension.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2. Mesenteric Vasculature:              Evidence of thromboembolic occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery with minimal collateral flow.         The mesenteric fat demonstrates stranding and edema, consistent with vascular compromise and inflammation secondary to ischemia.           3. Peritoneum:              Small volume free fluid within the peritoneal cavity, particularly around the small bowel loops and within the pelvis.         No evidence of free intraperitoneal air to suggest perforation at this time.           4. Other Findings:              Liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and bladder are unremarkable without acute findings.           Impression:              Severe ischemic bowel secondary to acute thromboembolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery.

Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is performed, showing 3 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL. His initial troponin I level is 0.08 ng/mL (reference range- <0.04 ng/mL). Echocardiogram is obtained with results available below. Here are the echocardiogram results.

Left Ventricle (LV):              Size: Normal         Wall Motion: Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) noted.                      Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.                  Overall Function: Consistent with myocardial ischemia/infarction involving the RCA territory.           2. Mitral Valve:              Structure: Leaflets and chordae appear intact.         Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) noted, likely secondary to papillary muscle dysfunction. No evidence of flail leaflet.           3. Right Ventricle (RV):              Size and Function: Normal size with preserved systolic function.           4. Pericardium:              No evidence of pericardial effusion.           5. Atria:              Left Atrium (LA): Normal size.         Right Atrium (RA): Normal size.           6. Aortic Valve:              Structure: Trileaflet, normal opening and closing.         Function: No aortic stenosis or regurgitation observed.           7. Tricuspid Valve:              Function: Trace tricuspid regurgitation (physiologic).         Right Atrial Pressure Estimate: Normal.

Initial treatment includes IV lorazepam, which briefly interrupts the seizures, but they recur within minutes. Given the persistence of his seizures, he is started on a loading dose of IV Medication B . Although this initially reduces the frequency of his seizures, they do not fully abate, and his condition escalates to refractory status epilepticus. In response, the team initiates a third antiseizure medication, IV Medication C , to achieve seizure control. The combination of Medication A, Medication B , and Medication C finally stabilizes him, but the complexity of managing his medication regimen remains high due to the interaction risks and side effects, necessitating careful monitoring in the ICU. Currently all are dosed twice daily at 0000 and 1200. He is now experiencing recurrent seizures. Currently Medication A and B are coadministered at 0000 and 1200, and Medication C is given at 0600 and 1800.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2. Mesenteric Vasculature:              Evidence of thromboembolic occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery with minimal collateral flow.         The mesenteric fat demonstrates stranding and edema, consistent with vascular compromise and inflammation secondary to ischemia.           3.
