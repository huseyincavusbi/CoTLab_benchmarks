They tend to fade and reappear, especially with crying, temperature changes, or exertion. They are very common in infants and often persist or fade over months to years. The description fits perfectly for a 6-month-old.\n*   **Other possibilities considered but less likely:**\n    *   *Port-wine stain (Nevus flammeus):* Usually present at birth, darker red/purple, doesn't typically fade/reappear, and persists/darkens over time.\n    *   *Hemangioma:* Often appears shortly after birth, grows rapidly in the first few months, then involutes. Usually raised and bright red (\"strawberry hemangioma\").\n    *   *Mongolian spots:* Blue-gray patches, usually on the lower back/buttocks, common in darker-skinned infants, typically fade by early childhood.\n    *   *Petechiae/Purpura:* Non-blanching, indicate bleeding under the skin.
