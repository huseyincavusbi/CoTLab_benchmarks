This is because alcohol directly damages the liver cells, leading to the release of both AST and ALT into the bloodstream.

The presence of symptoms would help narrow down the possibilities.\n```json\n{\n    \"diagnosis\": \"Elevated Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) in Pregnancy, Screen for Neural Tube Defect\",\n    \"confidence\": 95,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Elevated AFP in pregnancy is a common screening test to detect neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida and anencephaly.

Screen for neural tube defect\n\n1.  **Is the patient experiencing any symptoms?** (e.g., abdominal pain, bleeding, etc.)\n2.  **What are the patient's past medical and obstetric histories?** (e.g., previous pregnancies, complications, etc.)\n3.  **What is the gestational age of the pregnancy?** (This is crucial for interpreting AFP levels, as they change throughout pregnancy.)\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)",
      "cot_answer": "elevated alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in pregnancy, screen for neural tube defect",
      "cot_reasoning": "",
      "direct_response": "\n\nAnswer: Yes\nFinal Answer: Yes\nRationale: Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in maternal serum during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. Therefore, the presence of elevated AFP warrants further investigation to screen for NTDs.\nFinal Answer: Yes\nRationale: Elevated AFP is a sensitive marker for neural tube defects (NTDs) during pregnancy. Screening for NTDs is crucial when AFP levels are elevated to allow for timely",
