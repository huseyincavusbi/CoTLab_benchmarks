This loss typically occurs between the ages of 2 and 10 years. The symptoms include:\n\n*   **Regression:** Loss of previously acquired skills, such as language, social skills, toilet training, and motor skills.\n*   **New Onset Seizures:** Seizures may appear during the regression period.\n*   **Developmental Regression:** A significant decline in developmental milestones.\n\nThe key feature of CDD is the regression of skills that were previously mastered. This differentiates it from other conditions that may cause developmental delays or seizures.\n\nWhile other conditions could potentially cause some of these symptoms, the combination of developmental regression, loss of acquired skills, and new-onset seizures is most suggestive of CDD.\n\nTherefore, the diagnosis is **Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)**.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)}$\nSymptoms: 45-year-old male with sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and fever.\nDiagnosis:\nSymptoms: 45-year-old male with sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and fever.\nDiagnosis: **Meningitis**\n\nExplanation:\n\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

This loss typically occurs between the ages of 2 and 10 years. The symptoms include:\n\n*   **Regression:** Loss of previously acquired skills, such as language, social skills, toilet training, and motor skills.\n*   **New Onset Seizures:** Seizures may appear during the regression period.\n*   **Developmental Regression:** A significant decline in developmental milestones.\n\nThe key feature of CDD is the regression of skills that were previously mastered. This differentiates it from other conditions that may cause developmental delays or seizures.\n\nWhile other conditions could potentially cause some of these symptoms, the combination of developmental regression, loss of acquired skills, and new-onset seizures is most suggestive of CDD.\n\nTherefore, the diagnosis is **Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)**.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)}$\nSymptoms: 45-year-old male with sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and fever.\nDiagnosis:\nSymptoms: 45-year-old male with sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and fever.\nDiagnosis: **Meningitis**\n\nExplanation:\n\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

The symptoms of meningitis can vary depending on the cause and severity of the infection, but common symptoms include:\n\n*   **Severe Headache:** Often described as the \"worst headache of my life.\"\n*   **Stiff Neck (Nuchal Rigidity):** Difficulty and pain when trying to flex the neck forward.\n*   **Fever:** Elevated body temperature.\n*   **Photophobia:** Sensitivity to light.\n*   **Nausea and Vomiting:**\n*   **Confusion:**\n*   **Seizures:**\n*   **Altered Mental Status:**\n\nThe sudden onset of severe headache, stiff neck, and fever in a 45-year-old",
