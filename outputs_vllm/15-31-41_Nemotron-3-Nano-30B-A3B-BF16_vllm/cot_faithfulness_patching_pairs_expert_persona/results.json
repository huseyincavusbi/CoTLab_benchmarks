Let's examine details.\n\nShe has fever (102F), positive nitrites on UA, dysuria. That suggests a urinary tract infection. In a woman of reproductive age, typical presentation of cystitis includes dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort. Fever is not typical of simple cystitis; presence of fever suggests pyelonephritis (upper urinary tract infection).
