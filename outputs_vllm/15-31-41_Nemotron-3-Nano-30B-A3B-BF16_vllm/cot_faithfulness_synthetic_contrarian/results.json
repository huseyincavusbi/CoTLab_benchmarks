Relying solely on the pattern can lead to a mis\u2011label. |\n| **Variable presentation** | Not every patient with hyper\u2011thyroidism shows all four features; some present with only a few, and the severity can fluctuate. Conversely, a patient may have a milder form that mimics the classic picture without full biochemistry to confirm it. |\n| **Medication and iatrogenic causes** | Drugs such as **\u03b2\u2011agonists, steroids, lithium, amiodarone, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors** can provoke a hyper\u2011metabolic state or mimic its signs without an intrinsic thyroid problem. |\n| **Physiologic or lifestyle contributors** | Caffeine excess, nicotine, alcohol withdrawal, or intense stress can cause tremor, palpitations, and heat intolerance. These are benign mimics that resolve when the trigger is removed. |\n| **Systemic illnesses** | Conditions like **anemia, infection, or uncontrolled diabetes** can cause weight loss and autonomic over\u2011activity, overlapping with hyper\u2011thyroid signs. |\n| **Endocrine cross\u2011talk** | **Pheochromocytoma** or **adrenal hyperplasia** can secrete catecholamines that cause palpitations, tremor, and",
