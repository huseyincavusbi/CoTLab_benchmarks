      "cot_response": " Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.\"\n\nWe need to consider possible diagnoses causing persistent nasal congestion and noisy breathing in a 2-week-old infant, with improvement when crying.\n\nThe question likely is from pediatric otolaryngology or neonatology. The scenario: newborn 2 weeks old, persistent nasal congestion and noisy breathing, symptoms improve when crying. Could be due to \"laryngomalacia\"? But that causes noisy breathing (stridor), typically worsens with feeding, crying? Actually laryngomalacia: noisy breathing (stridor) that usually worsens with crying, feeding, lying on back; improves when infant is quiet? Not exactly. But the question says \"symptoms improve when crying\". That suggests that the noisy breathing is less when crying? Or the nasal congestion improves when crying? Actually \"symptoms improve when crying\" may refer to the nasal congestion and noisy breathing get better when the infant cries? That is odd. Let's parse: The baby has persistent nasal congestion and noisy breathing. Symptoms improve when crying. So maybe the baby has \"choanalasia\"? Or \"nasal foreign body\"? Or \"infantile allergic rhinitis\"? Or \"viral infection\"? But at 2 weeks old, it's early.\n\nCould be \"nasal congestion due to congenital nasal passage anomalies\"? Or \"laryngeal obstruction\"? Let's think.\n\nOne possibility: \"Infantile nasopharyngeal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids\"? Adenoids can cause nasal obstruction, but they enlarge later.\n\nCould be \"choanal atresia\"? That's a congenital malformation where the nasal passage is blocked by a membrane; presents with difficulty breathing through the nose, mouth breathing, maybe feeding difficulties. Usually presents soon after birth with persistent unilateral or bilateral nasal obstruction, especially when the infant is supine, feeding? But improvement with crying? Not sure.\n\nCould be \"Nasal vestibulitis\"? Or \"dry air\"? Or \"viral upper respiratory infection\"? But at 2 weeks, the mother may have passed some infection.\n\nAlternatively, \"laryngomalacia\" typically causes noisy breathing (stridor), which may be louder when the infant is quiet and feeding, and may improve with crying? Actually I recall that in laryngomalacia, the stridor may be heard during inspiration, often worsens with crying or feeding, but may improve when the baby is feeding or when the airway is opened? Let's recall details: Laryngomalacia is the most common",

In a 4-year-old boy with sudden onset severe testicular pain and swelling, absent cremasteric reflex suggests testicular torsion.

However, nitroblue tetrazolium test is used for chronic granulomatous disease? Actually nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT) is used to test for chronic granulomatous disease? Let's recall: The NBT test (nitroblue tetrazolium) is a test for oxidative burst in neutrophils. It is used to detect chronic granulomatous disease? Or is it used for myeloperoxidase deficiency? Actually NBT test is used to detect \"chronic granulomatous disease\" by measuring the ability of neutrophils to reduce NBT to formazan (blue). In CGD, neutrophils cannot generate reactive oxygen species, so they have reduced ability to reduce NBT? Let\u2019s recall details.\n\nChronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a genetic disorder of phagocytes that results in inability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to defects in NADPH oxidase components (gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox). Clinical features include recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia, Burkholderia, Nocardia, Aspergillus), formation of granulomas, and non-healing wounds. The diagnostic test includes the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, and the nitroblue tetrazolium slide test. The NBT test shows reduced ability of neutrophils to reduce NBT to blue formazan due to lack of oxidative burst.
