In a patient with pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis after a long flight, you must rule out \"pulmonary embolism.\" So answer: PE.\n\nBut maybe the question is more subtle: The scenario is typical for pulmonary embolism; but the question might be \"Which of the following must be ruled out?\" and the answer is \"Pulmonary embolism.\" However they might want to rule out \"PE\" as a cause of hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain; but also \"Aortic dissection\" could cause chest pain, but not hemoptysis. MI could cause chest pain but not hemoptysis. Tension pneumothorax can cause pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, but hemoptysis is less typical. The key is the risk factor: long flight -> risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) -> pulmonary embolism. So the answer is \"PE.\"\n\nBut perhaps the question is from a USMLE style: \"A patient with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis after a long flight. What must be ruled out?\" The answer is \"Pulmonary embolism.\" Or maybe they want \"PE must be ruled out before diagnosing other causes.\" Or \"Pulmonary embolism must be ruled out.\" So answer: PE.\n\nBut the question might be \"Which of the following must be ruled out?\" meaning \"Which of the following is the most likely cause?\" Actually the phrase \"must be ruled out\" implies that among the answer choices, one is the most dangerous condition that must be excluded. So it's likely \"PE.\"\n\nThus answer: Pulmonary embolism.\n\nBut maybe they want \"PE\"",

But also difficulty breathing suggests involvement of respiratory muscles. Could be \"myasthenic crisis\" or \"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)\" which can follow a viral infection, causing ascending paralysis and respiratory failure.\n\nThe question likely from a medical exam (maybe USMLE Step 1/2). They might ask \"What is the most likely cause of progressive muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and recent viral illness?\" The answer: \"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\" which is an autoimmune demyelinating neuropathy often triggered by Campylobacter, CMV, EBV, etc. It can cause respiratory muscle weakness leading to respiratory failure.\n\nAlternatively, could be \"myasthenia gravis\" which can also cause weakness and breathing difficulty, but it's not typically triggered by a viral illness; it's an autoimmune disease at the NMJ often associated with thymomas. However, some viral infections can trigger myasthenic crisis? Not typical.\n\nCould be \"Polymyositis\" or \"Dermatomyositis\"? Those cause progressive muscle weakness, but often not acute and not directly associated with viral illness. But some viral infections can cause inflammatory myopathy.\n\nThe phrase \"progressive muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and recent viral illness\" might be pointing to \"respiratory muscle weakness due to viral infection leading to hypoventilation.\" But likely they want \"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\" as the answer.\n\nBut let's examine typical board question phrasing. For GBS: \"A 28-year-old man presents with progressive symmetric weakness starting in the legs and ascending to the arms, paresthesias, areflexia, and facial droop. He recently had a diarrheal illness.\" That's typical. But here they mention difficulty breathing. In GBS, respiratory muscle involvement can cause difficulty breathing and may require mechanical ventilation. The question may be about \"Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\" Options might include Myasthenia gravis, ALS, Multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, etc. The correct answer would be GBS.\n\nAlternatively, could be \"Spinal muscular atrophy\"? But that's genetic, not viral.\n\nThe question might be about",

The cause is likely optic nerve pathology or acute retinal artery occlusion? Let's examine each option:\n\n- Glaucoma: Typically causes progressive peripheral vision loss, not sudden painless vision loss. Also not typically associated with afferent pupillary defect; maybe in acute angle-closure glaucoma there can be ocular pain, halos, but not typical. So unlikely.\n\n- Retinal detachment: Typically leads to flashes, floaters, curtain-like vision loss. Usually not associated with afferent pupillary defect; the afferent defect is due to retina? Usually not. Afferent pupillary defect can be seen with retinal lesions? Actually, afferent pupillary defect is due to optic nerve or severe retinal disease. Retinal detachment can cause afferent pupillary defect? Typically RAPD can be seen in optic nerve disease or severe retinal disease. In retinal detachment, the retina is detached, but there may be loss of function of photoreceptors causing relative afferent defect? I think RAPD can be seen in retinal detachment, but it's not typical. However the question likely expects \"Retinal artery occlusion\" because that leads to sudden painless vision loss (often \"amaurosis fugax\" or \"central retinal artery occlusion\" causing sudden monocular loss of vision). Afferent pupillary defect is present in central retinal artery occlusion because the afferent input is blocked.

In pediatric intussusception, the diagnosis is usually made by ultrasound; the treatment is hydrostatic reduction with contrast. However, the question asks \"next step in management?\" Might refer to \"barium enema\" or \"air enema\"? Let's think.\n\nIn a child with intussusception, the typical next step is \"ultrasound of abdomen\" to confirm diagnosis if uncertain.

However, the question may be about \"What is the next step in management?\" after diagnosing intussusception based on clinical presentation.
