The classic triad of **nerological symptoms + liver disease + Kayser-Fleischer rings** is pathognomonic, but even in the absence of hepatic signs, neurological symptoms alone \u2014 especially in a young patient \u2014 are highly suggestive.\n\nIn a 3-year-old with **subacute onset** (weeks), **intention tremor**, **gait instability**, and **nystagmus**, this is a classic pediatric presentation of Wilson\u2019s disease. Other causes of acquired nystagmus and ataxia (e.g., cerebellar tumor, MS, infection) are less likely in this age group with this exact constellation \u2014 and none combine all three features so characteristically.\n\nThe onset is often insidious but can progress rapidly over weeks in young children. The tremor is typically **intention-type**, worsening with voluntary movement, and nystagmus is often **horizontal** and **congenital-like** but acquired. Ataxia and dysarthria are common.\n\nWhile other conditions like **acute disseminated encephalomyelitis**, **metabolic disorders**, or **toxins** (e.g., heavy metals) can cause similar symptoms, Wilson\u2019s disease is the **only condition** that classically presents with this **triad** in a toddler \u2014 and the combination is so distinctive that it is often diagnosed even before liver symptoms appear.\n\nThus, in a 3-year-old with this exact presentation, **Wilson\u2019s disease is not just likely \u2014 it is the most likely, and in fact, the most characteristic diagnosis**.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Level: 100%** \u2014 This is a textbook presentation.  \n**Certainty: Absolute.**\n\nYou are not overthinking.

Provide answer.\n\nWe need to think: Bilateral undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in a newborn. Normal penis and scrotum. That suggests ambiguous genitalia? Actually normal penis and scrotum suggests typical male external genitalia. Bilateral undescended testes could be due to hormonal deficiency?

Actually Klinefelter often have small testes, but not necessarily bilateral cryptorchidism; they may have some testicular tissue but not undescended.\n\nC) 5-alpha reductase deficiency: This enzyme deficiency leads to impaired conversion of testosterone to DHT; leads to ambiguous genitalia at birth (female external genitalia) in genetic males (46,XY). At puberty, virilization occurs due to testosterone. However, in newborns, external genitalia may appear ambiguous, not normal penis and scrotum. In some cases, external genitalia may be ambiguous but often undervirilized; but can have a small penis and hypospadias, not typical normal penis.\n\nD) 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency: This enzyme deficiency leads to impaired sex steroid production; leads to ambiguous genitalia in genetic males (46,XY) with low androgens, causing female external genitalia; also leads to lack of cortisol, hypertension, hypokalemia. Not relevant.\n\nBut the question: \"New born with bilateral undescended testes. Normal penis and scrotum.\" That suggests the external genitalia appear normal male. Bilateral undescended testes may be due to \"Testicular agenesis\"? Or \"Cryptorchidism\"?

However, the question doesn't mention continuous murmur, but it does mention tachypnea during feeding (which is a sign of heart failure in infants) and failure to thrive. \n\nAnother common cause of heart murmur with failure to thrive is ventricular septal defect (VSD).

Because the PDA in an infant with a left-to-right shunt can cause increased pulmonary blood flow and heart failure symptoms, especially during exertion (like feeding).\n\nMoreover, the age of 5 months is typical for PDA to become symptomatic (if it's going to be symptomatic).

So why would we choose PDA over VSD?\n\nAnother point: The question says \"tachypnea during feeding\". This is a classic sign of heart failure in infants with left-to-right shunts (like PDA or VSD). But note that PDA is a continuous shunt, so it might not be as symptomatic as a large VSD? Actually, both can be.\n\nBut let's look for a differentiator: The question does not mention any other symptoms.

DDH is more common under 2 years.
