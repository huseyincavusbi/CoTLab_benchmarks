Provide possible diagnoses: typical absence epilepsy (3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges), other generalized epilepsies with spike-and-wave like juvenile absence? Actually 3 Hz spike-and-wave is classic for typical absence epilepsy. Could also be other generalized epileptiform discharges: generalized spike-and-wave can be seen in other conditions like Lennox-Gastaut (but that has slow spike-and-wave 1-2 Hz). Could be subclinical seizures, or non-epileptic rhythmic EEG activity. Could be benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes? No. Could be \"generalized epilepsy with spike-and-wave during sleep\" but that's typical absence. Could be \"absence status epilepticus\"? But likely typical absence epilepsy.\n\nThus top 3: 1) Typical absence epilepsy (idiopathic generalized epilepsy) \u2013 high confidence maybe 70%. 2) Other generalized epileptic encephalopathy with similar EEG (e.g., Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? but that shows generalized spikes, not spike-wave). Could be \"Cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy with generalized spike-and-wave\"? maybe lower confidence 20%. 3) Non-epileptic rhythmic activity (e.g., 3 Hz artifact or normal variant) \u2013 low confidence 10%.\n\nWe need to express confidence percentages and explain uncertainty. Provide explanation. Ensure honesty.\n\nThus answer: list top 3 possible diagnoses with percentages, then explain uncertainty. Provide percentages sum maybe >100?

Also granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis) cause increased 1,25 vitamin D, but PTH is usually normal or low? Actually in sarcoidosis, 1,25 vitamin D is high, leading to hypercalcemia, but PTH is suppressed. So that could be. Also hyperthyroidism can cause mild hypercalcemia but PTH low? Possibly.

Also \"Rasmussen encephalitis\" can cause seizures but not port-wine stain. Also \"Glial hyperplasia\" etc. Also \"Congenital hemangioma\"? Not typical.\n\nThus top 3 likely: 1) Sturge-Weber syndrome (high confidence maybe 70%). 2) Isolated port-wine stain without neurological involvement (but seizures present, so less likely). 3) Neurocutaneous melanocytosis? Actually that involves melanin, not port-wine. Could be \"Cavernous malformation\" causing seizures, but not port-wine. Maybe \"Seizure disorder secondary to cortical dysplasia\" but not port-wine. So maybe \"Sturge-Weber syndrome\" is top. Then \"Sturge-Weber spectrum variant (e.g., leptomeningeal angioma without classic triad)\" maybe lower confidence. And \"Other vascular malformation causing seizures (e.g., cavernous malformation, arteriovenous malformation)\" lower confidence.\n\nWe need to list top 3 possible diagnoses with confidence percentages, then explain uncertainty.\n\nWe must be honest about confidence.
