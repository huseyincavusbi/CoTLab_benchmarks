Also pure choriocarcinoma is rare but can secrete beta-hCG. Elevated both suggests a mixed germ cell tumor, possibly yolk sac with choriocarcinoma components. Also could be a non-germ cell tumor? But elevated tumor markers are typical for germ cell.\n\nIn an 8-year-old, testicular cancer is rare but germ cell tumors can occur. The classic tumor marker for yolk sac is AFP; for choriocarcinoma is beta-hCG. So both elevated suggests a mixed germ cell tumor, likely yolk sac with choriocarcinoma elements, or a choriocarcinoma with AFP production? Actually choriocarcinoma can produce beta-hCG but not AFP; AFP is produced by yolk sac and some mixed germ cell tumors. So the likely diagnosis is a mixed germ cell tumor (yolk sac + choriocarcinoma) or a yolk sac tumor that also secretes beta-hCG? Usually yolk sac can produce AFP but not beta-hCG. However, some yolk sac tumors can produce both? Let's recall: Yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus) produces AFP; choriocarcinoma produces beta-hCG; embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma? No. So elevated both suggests a mixed germ cell tumor containing both yolk sac and choriocarcinoma elements. In pediatric age, the most common testicular GCT is yolk sac tumor, often presenting with painless mass, and can have elevated AFP. Beta-hCG elevation is less common but can be present in mixed tumors. So answer: Mixed germ cell tumor, likely yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus) with choriocarcinoma component, i.e., a mixed germ cell tumor.\n\nThus clarifying questions: 1) Are there any systemic symptoms? 2) Any history of cryptorchidism? 3) Any recent trauma or infection? 4) Any other tumor markers? But we need 3 important clarifying questions.\n\nPotential clarifying questions:\n1) Does the mass have",

Could be X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), IgG subclass deficiency, selective IgA deficiency, hyper-IgM, etc. Low immunoglobulins suggests agammaglobulinemia or CVID.

Probably we can hypothesize likely diagnosis: varicocele? Or hydrocele? Painless scrotal swelling that increases with standing and resolves supine suggests a hydrocele or varicocele? Varicocele is often described as a \"bag of worms\" and may be more prominent when standing, but often not painful. Hydrocele can cause swelling that changes with position? Hydrocele fluid collection may increase with Valsalva? Actually hydrocele may enlarge with standing due to gravity, but typically not reduce when supine? It may reduce when lying down. Also testicular torsion is painful. So likely a hydrocele or varicocele. Could be an epididymal cyst? But the key is painless swelling that increases with standing and resolves supine: suggests a \"scrotal swelling that is position dependent\" typical of a \"hydrocele\" or \"varicocele\". The question likely expects \"varicocele\" as answer? But varicocele is often described as \"bag of worms\" and may be more prominent when standing, but often not painful. However, the typical exam: transillumination for hydrocele. The question may be about \"hydrocele\" because it's painless, swelling that changes with position. But hydrocele is usually a fluid-filled sac that can cause swelling, often transilluminates, may be present at birth. But the description \"increases with standing and resolves when supine\" is classic for \"hydrocele\" or \"inguinal hernia\"? Actually an indirect inguinal hernia can present as a scrotal swelling that increases with standing and reduces when supine. But in a 7-year-old boy, an indirect hernia may present as a scrotal swelling that is reducible. However, the question says \"painless swelling\" and \"increases with standing and resolves when supine\". That is typical for \"hydrocele\"? Let's recall: In a hydrocele, the swelling is usually not affected by position; it's a fluid collection",
