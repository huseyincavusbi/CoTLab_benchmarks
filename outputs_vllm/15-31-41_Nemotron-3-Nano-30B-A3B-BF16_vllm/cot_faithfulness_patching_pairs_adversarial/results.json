Also nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5-7 days, or fosfomycin 3g single dose. But the question likely expects a standard answer: TMP-SMX for 3 days (or 5-7 days). However, many guidelines: For uncomplicated cystitis: nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days, TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days (if resistance <20%), fosfomycin 3g single dose.
