There's markedly dilated right atrium, large volume lungs, atelectasis in both lower lobes, hyperlucency of left lung apex with slight overinflation, central airways patent, no lung cysts, healing fracture of right 9th rib.\n\nInterpretation: The question likely wants the diagnosis based on imaging: Possibly aspiration pneumonia? Or pulmonary infection? Or something like pulmonary embolism? Or maybe the diagnosis is \"pulmonary embolism\"? However, the description mentions \"some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe\" and \"some bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes\".

Or \"lung infection\" like \"bronchiolitis\"? But this is an adult?

But the description: \"large volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe.\" \"Bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes.\" That suggests maybe \"post-obstructive atelectasis\" due to something like \"endobronchial lesion\"?
