Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent.

Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior.

The task is to answer appropriately, probably as a clinician responding to the alert.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the report. The main findings are cardiac issues: ASD and VSD with a dilated right atrium, patent pulmonary veins. Lung findings include large volume, atelectasis in lower lobes, hyperlucency in the left apex with rightward displacement of the anterior junction line, which suggests localized overinflation. Central airways are patent, no cysts.

The rib fracture is unexpected because it wasn't seen before 16th July, and it's likely from the current admission.
