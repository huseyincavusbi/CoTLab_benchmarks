The report describes it as \"healing,\" which suggests it's a prior injury that's in the process of healing. But the instructions specify that a pathological fracture is one with direct signs like periosteal reaction, callus, or other indicators of malignancy or abnormality. The term \"healing\" here doesn't mention any such pathological features. It just notes that it's old and healing, which is typical for a non-pathological fracture. There's no language like \"malignant,\" \"lytic,\" \"periosteal reaction,\" or \"aggressive appearance\" that would indicate pathology. \n\nThe example given in Example 2 had a displaced rib fracture but no pathological signs, so it was marked as non-pathological.

So \"pathological_fracture\" should be false.\n\nNow, I need to extract the evidence. The report finding is the exact phrase about the old rib fracture.
