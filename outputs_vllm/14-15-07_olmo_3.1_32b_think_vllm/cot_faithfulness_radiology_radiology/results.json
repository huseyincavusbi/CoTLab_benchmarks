Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

No previous relevant imaging available for comparison at time of reporting. The patient was scanned using a vacuum immobilisation bag due to motion concerns. This results in a linear artefact in the anteroposterior direction, most evident at the level of the corona radiata and posterior fossa, limiting assessment in these regions -Within the above limitation, no evidence of acute intracranial haemorrhage or established territorial infarction. -No midline shift or signs of transtentorial or uncal herniation. -The foramen magnum is capacious, with no tonsillar herniation. -No acute calvarial fracture is identified. -Ventricular size and configuration are within normal limits. -No hydrocephalus or sulcal effacement.\n\nOpinion: No acute intracranial haemorrhage, infarction, or herniation identified within the limitations of linear artefact from the immobilisation bag. No acute calvarial fracture.\n\nDr Oliver Matthews, Radiology Registrar ST4 Approved by Dr Rachel Patel, Consultant Neuroradiologist GMC-8126745 19/10/2025, 15:52",

The user wants me to analyze a radiology report to determine if there's a fracture mentioned and if it's pathological. The key points from the instructions are crucial here.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the report explicitly mentions a bone fracture. Looking at the provided report, the findings state: \"No acute calvarial fracture is identified.\" That's a clear mention of a fracture, but it's negative. The question is whether the presence of the term \"fracture\" here counts as it being mentioned. The example given in Example 1 had \"bilateral clavicle fractures\" which was a positive mention. Here, it's stating the absence, but the word \"fracture\" is still present. However, the instruction says to determine if a fracture is \"explicitly described.\" Since the report is denying its presence, does that count as mentioning it? The user's first step is to check if it's explicitly described. In this case, the report does mention \"calvarial fracture\" but in a negative context. But according to the examples, even a negative statement might still trigger \"fracture mentioned\" as true? Wait, in Example 2, the report mentions a displaced rib fracture, so that's a positive mention. Here, the report is saying there is no fracture. So perhaps \"fracture mentioned\" should be false because it's not present, but the word is used in negation. Wait, the instruction says \"determine whether a bone fracture is explicitly described in the report.\" The term \"calvarial fracture\" is explicitly mentioned, but in a negative statement. The user's examples don't have negative cases. Let me check the examples again. In Example 1, the report had positive findings of fractures. Example 2 had a positive mention of a rib fracture. So if the report says \"no fracture\", does that count as the fracture being mentioned? The user's instruction might consider any mention of the term as \"mentioned\", even if it's denying it.
