What is the most urgent concern?\nDiagnosis: Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident)\nUrgency: High / Life-threatening\nExplanation: These symptoms strongly suggest a stroke, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Prompt medical intervention is crucial to minimize brain damage and potential long-term disability.\n---\nSymptoms: A 5-year-old child with high fever, difficulty breathing, and a barking cough. What is the most urgent concern?\nDiagnosis: Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)\nUrgency: Moderate / Potentially Life-threatening\nExplanation: Croup is an inflammation of the upper airway, which can cause significant breathing difficulties, especially in young children.

Prompt diagnosis and surgical removal of the appendix are necessary.\n---\nSymptoms: A 60-year-old male with sudden severe headache, confusion, and loss of consciousness. What is the most urgent concern?\nDiagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nUrgency: High / Life-threatening\nExplanation: A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the space surrounding the brain, often caused by a ruptured aneurysm. It is a medical emergency that can cause significant brain damage or death if not treated immediately.\n---\nSymptoms: A 25-year-old female with sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and dizziness.
