This can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, particularly in athletes.\n    *   **Long QT Syndrome (LQTS):** An inherited electrical disorder of the heart that increases the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias (like Torsades de Pointes) triggered by exercise, stress, or certain medications.\n    *   **Brugada Syndrome:** Another inherited electrical disorder increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, often occurring during rest or sleep, but can be triggered by exercise.\n    *   **Myocarditis:** Inflammation of the heart muscle, often viral, which can cause chest pain, arrhythmias, and heart failure. While less likely to be the *primary* cause of SCD related to exertion in this specific scenario compared to HCM, it's still a consideration.\n    *   **Commotio Cordis:** A rare event where a sudden, blunt impact to the chest causes ventricular fibrillation and SCD.

It affects muscles closer to the trunk (shoulders, hips, thighs) more than distal muscles (hands, feet).\n2.  **Heliotrope rash:** This is a characteristic skin finding in dermatomyositis. It's a purplish or violaceous rash typically found on the eyelids and around the eyes, often accompanied by periorbital edema.\n\n**Dermatomyositis** is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by both muscle weakness (primarily proximal and symmetric) and distinctive skin manifestations. The heliotrope rash is one of the most specific skin signs. Other common skin findings include Gottron's papules (scaly bumps over the knuckles), Gottron's sign (erythema over the extensor surfaces of joints like elbows and knees), shawl sign (erythema over the upper back and shoulders), and V-sign (erythema over the anterior chest).\n\n**Differential Diagnoses (and why they are less likely):**\n\n*   **Polymyositis:** Similar muscle weakness but lacks the characteristic skin rashes of dermatomyositis.\n*   **Inclusion Body Myositis:** Typically affects older individuals, often involves distal muscles (finger flexors, wrist flexors, quadriceps), and weakness can be asymmetric. No characteristic rash.\n*   **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** Can cause muscle weakness (myalgia/myositis) and various rashes (malar rash, discoid rash), but the heliotrope rash is highly specific for dermatomyositis.\n*   **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):** Features overlap with SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Can have muscle weakness and rashes, but the specific combination points more strongly to dermatomyositis.\n*   **Drug-induced myopathy:** Can cause proximal weakness, but usually lacks the characteristic skin findings. Statins are a common cause.\n*   **Muscular Dystrophies:** Genetic disorders causing progressive muscle weakness.

PTH increases blood calcium levels by:\n    *   Increasing bone resorption (releasing calcium from bones).\n    *   Increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.\n    *   Increasing the production of active vitamin D (calcitriol), which enhances calcium absorption from the intestines.\n    *   Therefore, hypercalcemia is a hallmark of this condition.\n\n2.  **Recurrent Kidney Stones:** High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) lead to increased calcium excretion in the urine (hypercalciuria). This increased concentration of calcium in the urine can precipitate and form calcium-containing kidney stones (most commonly calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stones). Recurrent stones are a common complication.\n\n**Other potential, but less likely, causes to consider:**\n\n*   **Malignancy:** Some cancers can cause hypercalcemia (either through bone metastases or by producing PTH-related peptide - PTHrP). However, recurrent kidney stones are less directly associated unless the hypercalcemia is chronic and severe.\n*   **Sarcoidosis/Granulomatous Diseases:** These can cause hypercalcemia due to extra-renal production of active vitamin D by macrophages in granulomas.
