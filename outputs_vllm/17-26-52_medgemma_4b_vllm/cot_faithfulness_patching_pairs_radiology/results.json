The upper face receives bilateral innervation from the motor cortex, while the lower face receives primarily contralateral innervation. Therefore, a central facial palsy typically spares the forehead muscles because the upper face receives bilateral input.\n\nIn contrast, peripheral facial palsy (Bell's palsy) involves the facial nerve outside the brainstem.
