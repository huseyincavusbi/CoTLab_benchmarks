Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): This is a blockage of the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is CRAO.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a serious condition that can cause sudden, painless vision loss. It occurs when the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina, becomes blocked. This blockage can be caused by a blood clot, cholesterol plaque, or other debris that travels from the heart or carotid arteries to the eye.\n\nThe classic finding in CRAO is a \"cherry-red spot\" in the macula. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. In CRAO, the surrounding retina becomes pale and ischemic due to lack of blood flow. However, the macula receives some blood supply from the choroid, which lies beneath the retina. This choroidal blood supply makes the macula appear red in contrast to the pale, ischemic retina.\n\nThe sudden vision loss and the cherry-red spot are highly suggestive of CRAO. Other conditions that can cause sudden vision loss include retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and optic neuritis. However, the cherry-red spot is a relatively specific finding for CRAO.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe key features are:\n1.

While other conditions can cause abdominal pain, the improvement with eating is a strong indicator of a duodenal ulcer.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Duodenal ulcer}$\nThe question is \"Abdominal pain improves with eating. This is duodenal ulcer\". The key information is that the abdominal pain improves with eating. This is characteristic of a duodenal ulcer.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Duodenal ulcer}$\nThe correct answer is **Duodenal ulcer**.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"abdominal pain improves with eating\" is a key symptom of a duodenal ulcer.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): This is a blockage of the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is CRAO.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a serious condition that can cause sudden, painless vision loss. It occurs when the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina, becomes blocked. This blockage can be caused by a blood clot, cholesterol plaque, or other debris that travels from the heart or carotid arteries to the eye.\n\nThe classic finding in CRAO is a \"cherry-red spot\" in the macula. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. In CRAO, the surrounding retina becomes pale and ischemic due to lack of blood flow. However, the macula receives some blood supply from the choroid, which lies beneath the retina. This choroidal blood supply makes the macula appear red in contrast to the pale, ischemic retina.\n\nThe sudden vision loss and the cherry-red spot are highly suggestive of CRAO. Other conditions that can cause sudden vision loss include retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and optic neuritis. However, the cherry-red spot is a relatively specific finding for CRAO.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe key features are:\n1. Sudden vision loss\n2. Cherry red spot\n\nThese are highly suggestive of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe sudden vision loss and cherry-red spot are classic signs of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe sudden onset of vision loss coupled with the presence of a cherry-red spot strongly points to a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Central retinal artery occlusion}$\nThe patient's presentation of",

These lesions are usually present at birth or shortly after, and they typically resolve within a few days to a couple of weeks. The cause of ETN is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the mother's immune response to the baby's skin.
