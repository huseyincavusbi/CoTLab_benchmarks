Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission. Alert raised for incidental rib fracture.\n\n--------------\nHOSPITAL ALERT This imaging examination has an UNEXPECTED FINDING and needs your review.

Pulmonary veins are broadly patent. The lungs are of large volume. There are bands of atelectasis in both lower lobes. There is slight hyperlucency of the left lung apex with slight rightward displacement of the anterior junction line suggesting some localised overinflation. The central airways are patent. No lung cysts. There is a healing fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the right 9th rib. Subtle callus formation is probably visible on chest radiograph dated 16/07/2025, but not on prior radiographs.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLarge volume lungs with some atelectasis, some focal hyperinflation in left upper lobe. Findings may reflect infection eg bronchiolitis, but in the context aspiration may also be considered. Incidentally demonstrated healing fracture of the right 9th posterolateral rib. This was demonstrable in retrospect on the radiograph dated 16/07/2025 but not prior. It is unlikely this fracture was sustained more than 10 days prior to the last radiograph where fracture not visible (13th July), ie not before 3rd July, and therefore likely sustained during the current admission.

The shunt is typically placed surgically to treat hydrocephalus (excess CSF in the brain).\n\n*   **Dry tap:** This is a procedure where the shunt is temporarily disconnected from its reservoir (usually the abdomen) to allow CSF to flow freely through the system. This allows the radiologist to assess the shunt's functionality and identify any potential blockages or other problems.\n\n*   **Assessment:** The radiologist (Dr. Richardson) is evaluating the shunt system to determine if it is functioning properly and to identify any issues that may need to be addressed before surgery.\n\n*   **Surgical exploration:** The recommendation for surgical exploration implies that the radiologist has found something concerning during the dry tap that requires further investigation and potential surgical correction.\n\n**In summary, the case describes a routine dry tap of a VP shunt for assessment prior to planned surgical intervention.**\n07/11/2025, 08:15, XR CEREBRO-SPINAL FLUID SHUNT\n\nCase History:\n\nReason for Request: Dry shunt tap, to assess shunt system prior to surgical exploration\n\nFindings: VP shunt tubing position as demonstrated no evidence of kink or fracture.
